It follows a conversation in part one, interestingly enough, where we had a panelists from all over the world talking about the impact of globalization and their perspective on it in the world of improv. And this continues that conversation. There is not really a separate topic, but there are a number of additional thoughts and we do get into some new territory that I think was very valuable and impactful. So I encourage you to listen in all the way through and get those insights along the way. So let's get right into part two.

So Korea also had the early stages with China. So we started COVID in January and nowadays it's been four months, five months and it's getting better and better. So I think this is a hope for worldwide people because these days for 10 days, we have less than 10 COVID virus patients right now. So we starting slowly, we are getting back to the normal life, not fully, but slowly we started to work outside and we go for work and small group gathering. So we started to offline meeting less than 10 people right now. It's only just since the last week because three, two, three weeks ago we had an election and so many people voted and experts predicted after voting date after two weeks there will be juicy coronavirus patients again. But it turns out we have no one from the election situation. We have no zero one. So it's very good news for everybody, I think. So you guys were maybe come back for the normal life. I hope everyone worldwide. And also during the four months, we really needed the gathering paper and we wanted to talk. So we started online as everyone did. So my feeling, my thoughts about online improv is totally different genre I feel. So it's improv, of course, but very different. For example, when we were on stage, we cannot do the finger one, finger or face one or we cannot do the zoom background, the white horizons or Mars and artisans. So we also created new forms with online only. So it's also new invention or new discovery for us.

I've been working on videos and training and trying stuff with my in-pro group. We have rehearsals and we try stuff and that's great because it's like how powerful it is for humans to have the creativity and also when it goes to the dark side, it's very dangerous. And we have proofs of those things. So yeah, that in one side, like I've been very, as I told you, very like I don't want to go in this online thing. As soon as this started, I got like a lot of messages, like let's do this, let's do this. And as Joel said, like first I need to go inside and understand how I'm feeling about all this thing. And then I will go out probably and do my stuff. So I think it's very important to take the time to understand as humans what is happening. And as a human, how this is affecting me, what is this making me think and feel about life? And hopefully how it's changing me for better, no? So yeah, I close that idea there and just connecting to the past thing about teaching and learning. When Patti was speaking, I got this idea that it's very important as teachers to be aware of teach people to learn. You know, the typical thing, don't give people fish, teach them how to fish. But if you are able to teach people to be open and to understand that what you're saying is just one point of view that you have developed and you have accumulated knowledge in that specific point of view or some or a mix, that point is as valid as any other point that you can find in the world. And that point is just one. So I think that is really important. Like you're giving tools and then people can play with the tools, but you're not saying any truth.

So to follow a little bit on what Felipe was just saying about teachers, I really think it's our job to kind of inspire thought. So to provide tools, but inspire thought and questioning, our job as a teacher isn't to come in and give the absolutes. It might be your personal discovery. It might be your code that you follow. It might be the way you work, but it shouldn't be the overall to find the way everyone should. And I think that's really important in improvisation and teaching in general. If we can inspire our students to be curious and to question and then to take what we've shared and apply it, use it, explore it in their own way, I think that provides a healthier community than coming in and saying follow my 10 rules because this is what I'm gonna tell you what to do. Doesn't mean that you can't be passionate about what you do. Doesn't mean that you don't, you can't come in and say, ""I believe this."" 'Cause I think a passionate teacher is a great teacher, but a passionate teacher should also be open to be questioned and to have other opinions in the room. So that on the teaching front. On the teaching online front or being online or performing online, there are a lot of possibilities. It's a new toy, it's a new tool. And I think it's really serving a function like right now, how many different countries are having a conversation right now. But I do think conversation and connection are different and we're having a conversation right now and I feel connected in thoughts and ideas and words, but I don't feel the connection of space. This is not a space. This is a bubble of time. This is not a shared space for me personally. And when I'm teaching, I really rely on looking at the body language of people, who's comfortable, who's present, who's feeling a bit uncomfortable or awkward, where's the fear, who's connecting, where's the inspiration. That is such an important component of our work is embracing the individuality of every student. Who a person is is your first offer as a teacher. And through this, I'm getting a small component of that information. Now, I can still use it, so I'm not trying to be critical of the new tool. I'm just being aware that this tool is very different. Online is not theater. And a lot of the improvisation techniques that we have are about performance, in live performance. So we are using tools in one area differently, and that's fine. However, I do want to say to the improvisers out there that are going, ""I don't like this. ""This is not my thing. ""I'm feeling really conflicted, compromised."" But everybody's saying, ""It's great, we can connect, ""we can play, it's wonderful. ""It's okay if it's not your wonderful."" You're not a bad improviser, because this is difficult. You are not, you haven't failed as an improviser, 'cause you're having a hard time adjusting to this, or you don't want to adjust to this. People have different relationships with technology, and there's different generations of people with technology. For some people, online social has been the way they've communicated since a very young age. For other people, it's still new. And there are so many different platforms of communication. So it's okay if this isn't your thing. You're not failing as an improviser. You are still a part of the community. Some people don't have the technology to be able to use this. So as we look at creating open spaces and inclusive spaces for people in theater, we also have to look at this as being inclusive. And part of that in inclusiveness is, there are some people right now that are gonna be sitting on the sidelines, and they are still welcome, and they are still included, and it's absolutely fine, 'cause this can be exhausting. That's all.",SPEAKER_05,677.44,980.36,302.92,https://anchor.fm/s/debdff4/podcast/play/13465947/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-4-8%2F71293346-48000-2-f839edbfc229e.mp3,18,NO_INFERRED_ROLE,NO_INFERRED_SPEAKER,,,,

I think I'll first extract what I think Patty said, just to boil that one piece of that is it's not a, this isn't the same sense of connection for many of us, including me. But this is a form of connection. And then for some people who are used to connecting in this way, whether they're introverted or visual learner or whatever, this could very well be connection for them. But for those of us that are kinesthetic and that like to need to be in the same room and have our intuition come into play, I wouldn't say it's not, this is just different. I definitely can connect in a way here. An example I would give about the difference because I see Kiza here is the first time we got to play together as a duo was in a comedy sports match in Connecticut. And so it was Kiza and I against a team of four younger women and we really had never played together. But we've loved each other since we've met and our energy is our energy. And we have that thing that is real life in person people who have kinesthetic connection. And our set just killed and we ended up doing a song, a cappella and it was great. But the different example is that team challenged us in 30 seconds to make them cry and we did. And it's because they were two people who loved each other who had no other choice but to break up and to part. And that distance and that kinesthetic experience that being in the same room made them cry, especially the person that suggested it. And I don't think you could do that online. It doesn't make online worse. It just makes it not appropriate for that form of theater, for that suggestion, that whatever. And so, and there are some people who are absolutely allowed to not want to give that suggestion, take that suggestion, cry because Kiza and I made them cry. That can also not be your thing. But for us, that is clearly our thing. And so that's, I would just offer that up as just a piece of dynamic that I'm personally missing. We're teaching online is concerned. Well, let me back up and just say, I've always for a long time. And actually, since Patty and I started playing together almost 10 years ago, have made it a point to say, I'm going to teach you a way to improvise but I'm not going to teach you the way to improvise. And to Felipe's point about helping people learn, if I can show you a way to improvise and then help make that accessible to the different ways that people learn here, then I'm helping people learn to fish without saying this is how you fish. And then in the online thing, because yes, I, Cheng Zeng said, hey, do you want to teach a thing? And we talked a little bit about it. I had to figure out what it was that this thing was, and I had to start with what is this instead of what have I been doing for 40 years? Okay, what is this delivery system? What am I passionate about in terms of how I play here? And there are, there's just a lot of things I wasn't, it wasn't obvious to me what it was that I would be passionate about playing here. But to John's point, I said this in our first thing, it was like, it's about human connection. And whether it's about, hey, I want to get back to, I want to get with people that are all going to have a barbecue, they're all going to cook out. We're going to do that thing here that we might do in real life. Or will Lewera and Sarasota's having like a campfire? And he has a computer outside and there's a campfire and he has people in and we have a campfire. Like that's something like, oh, I could do that if I didn't live in Chicago and you never knew what the weather was going to be. But I think it's a, we can show people a way to learn. And I think if we're going to be teachers online, the advice would be like, figure out what about this given can have us be passionate to give who we are into this and not think about, I'm going to teach what I'm missing because it's somewhere else. And there's my thoughts. - One,",SPEAKER_02,982.64,1261.14,278.5,https://anchor.fm/s/debdff4/podcast/play/13465947/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-4-8%2F71293346-48000-2-f839edbfc229e.mp3,19,NO_INFERRED_ROLE,NO_INFERRED_SPEAKER,,,,

But it strikes me that there are a lot more folks who may not have had as much opportunity or presence or respect in their communities who are stepping forward now. This is not a complete thought, but I feel like it's worth paying attention to whether we gave the right amount of space to people in our communities and now that there is a new medium and new space that they're taking advantage of it.

And that is one thing that I love doing when I travel internationally is playing, but also teaching, where people who have a different mother tongue play a scene together in their home language.

We don't need to speak each other's personal language to understand each other. If we're paying attention to each other through love and on a human level, we can get the nature of what we're communicating about on a human level.

So, because another thing about our In Prevention Festival that delighted me, kind of unexpectedly, was because we had mainly mix of shows and shows that people had learnt from directors, from workshops in that show. People, there was always one or two cast members, perhaps from a bigger city that had been, they're good improvisers, but they've been overlooked for, for central ensembles and things like that. But people coming from overseas, great directors from overseas, they don't know who these people are. They've just decided on their cast for a show from what they've seen in the workshop, or who's come along. And so, what I can say is I took great delight in seeing those sorts of people, get selected by a Joe or a Felipe or Patty, and then be in a great show with all these known people, do a great job. Well, I'll tell you what, when they went back to their hometown then, then they were in the main ensemble. So, we can pretty quickly. So, I think you're absolutely right, that no matter how giving and sharing we think we are, there is a part of nature's and company nature that is protective and delays progress for some people that could have progress faster. And so, I guess, yeah, one of the great things about where we find ourselves at this moment is a little bit of an equalizer again for people to appear. So, I think, yeah, we need to embrace that. I fall a little bit into the Felipe category of, I feel like if I go online to teach, it's just not going to be as good a product as face to face and that I've been so obsessed, well, not obsessed, yes, obsessed. But I feel like most of what I've been working towards is face to face human connection, live almost in response to where society was going, becoming more of a screen culture, people forgetting how to talk to each other and so on. And now we've got to reverse that. So, I'm still trying to work out how to embrace the new opportunities. So, one thing that happened actually was that our local government here in my region of Australia created some small grants for artists to say, well, if we just gave you some money in this difficult time, how would you spend your time? You can use it for your living expenses. You don't have to propose a project, but what would you do? And so, I applied for that and decided that, look, what I will do actually, and I'm doing, is taking a step back rather than rushing to put what I normally do or what first comes to mind onto the screen, to take a step back and go, well, let's use this time, let's consult with some video people, let's consult with some online course people and try to work out, well, what is a genuinely high quality, useful product that I can put online? So, it'll be much slower than most people getting it up, but I'm hopeful that this isn't going to go away, this online learning thing. So, I'm hopeful that at least in my untekky situation, that I will improve what I can present that way. But it also got me thinking about how we come out of this, because I still feel extremely passionate about the human-to-human connection, how we learn to become vulnerable and intimate with each other and consensual in that and respecting each other face-to-face. And it strikes me that our world is upside down now in terms of what we're told is what is healthy to do. Here in Australia, and certainly in my city, over summer, we were blanketed in bush by a smoke. And so, we were told, okay, here's the healthy thing to do. Stay indoors, never go outside and sit on your butt, not doing much so that you don't have to breathe too much. That was the new healthy instead of go outside and exercise. And now the new healthy with very, very strong advertising and pushing is stay away from each other, maintain a distance, try not to breathe on anyone by talking at them too close and so on. And already, you can see people's behavioral change when you do see them face-to-face. So when we come back to the face-to-face environment, we're going to have even more people, even more anxious about being vulnerable connected to each other. Even more people who are afraid of touch and so on. And so, I'm not proposing that I have particular answers to that, but I'm saying that's an area that I really want to work on too in this time. How do we come out of this zone and help people again, readjust to that face-to-face thing that we love as well as embracing the online thing? And as a final thing I just wanted to say, we talked a lot about embracing the change and the differences from other cultures to learn from them. And we also talked about what seems to be the opposite of maintaining your own culture and not letting go of that in the face of what seems to be strong influences. I just want to close by saying, I think they're the same thing because if you learn from one other influence, two, maybe three other influences, yes, you can have this feeling of being inadequate, a fraud, learning from something bigger than yourself. But if you get enough different influences coming in and that's just how you think, I love to get different influences, I love my processes to be challenged, then eventually it comes to the question, wait a minute, well, who am I as an improviser? And eventually your answer becomes, well, I'm okay. And these are the things about me or my culture or my group that are actually different. You end up answering that question and your acceptance from being involved in shows in different languages with people that you don't understand and all of these types of experiences that we've talked about and nothing goes wrong, you're accepted, leads you to discover your own strength as an improviser, leads you to discover that you do have your own identity and leads you to have the confidence to put forward your own identity. So my message too, it provides us listening, is you do have a cultural identity. You may not see it because you've grown up with it, it just seems something normal, perhaps boring to you, but it's there. And by engaging and exposing yourself to all these different cultures and influences, you might rediscover what's interesting about you that you can present to us and that we need to hear from you. -",SPEAKER_01,1400.29,1984.27,583.98,https://anchor.fm/s/debdff4/podcast/play/13465947/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-4-8%2F71293346-48000-2-f839edbfc229e.mp3,28,NO_INFERRED_ROLE,NO_INFERRED_SPEAKER,,,,

One thing that came to mind from what Nick was just saying right now is like hopefully partially, it's also when we have been away from each other physically for so long, there is the need to be together. So maybe even some of the, I was one of my students said at some point, maybe our culture will change somehow and the cheek kisses will become a thing in Finland, which is absolutely not the thing at the moment. And I thought that that was wonderful to think about, maybe changes the way we like, we miss each other's physical presences. So maybe that is also partially can be a wonderful, beautiful thing and we can be helpful in that for sure. A few more things that came to my mind from all of this, someone was writing about the fact that when you meet people on Zoom or on other kind of platform like this, everyone is high status the whole time. And I thought that it was a very interesting idea of like, we are looking at each other's faces the whole time and it's here on the, and that can be very draining. That can be very, very tiring as well. So then I wanted to say when people were saying like, they started like, okay, I need this time to think first what is happening and how I'm feeling about it. And then slowly getting into it. I think that to me it has been the opposite way. And I also want to say to other people that it's okay. Also if it goes in a way that first you're like, okay, let's do this, let's change this. Let's go into this thing and just be curious, oh change everything. And then slowly you're like, oh, this is exhausting. I'm tired, I can't do this. And that is also completely okay. The way you are feeling about everything that's going on in the world and the way it affects you is okay. So I want to put that out there as well as like, and we're living in a situation where we probably in this way have never been before. And it's okay to feel the way you feel about it. - One more thing that I think at least Joe was mentioning about the closeness and that kind of intimacy and Patty as well about whether it's being together or if it's just a time where we are sharing or having a discussion, right. I got to teach a workshop on the info fest online thing that they're doing in Germany or everywhere in the world, I guess, but that they're hosting from there. And so I wanted to try how it is when the topic of the workshop is closeness and intimacy online. And I thought that it was quite interesting to see how because we were actually looking at it from the perspective of like, we are now globally in a situation where we cannot be physically close even to those people, to a lot of those people that we would like to be our families or our friends or our loved ones. And I thought that it was really interesting to see, to see how people wanted that connection and how they would apply that to the situation that we are at the moment. And how we are, even in my real life, I usually tend to see my family, my siblings, my parents, people in our family, maybe two times a year, if it's a good year that we all get together. And this has made me, and I believe a lot of other people as well, wanting to see and be in connection with other people more than maybe in our busy day-to-day lives normally. And I'm truly hoping that that is something that will continue to be. So after this, because we're going to enter into a world which I believe that will not be the same normal world that we were in before. But instead, it's going to be a new version of the world. And if we as humans don't completely beat it up, then we will be part of it in the future as well. And what will remain is this need for connection. And this need for being in contact with other people. And as Felipe was saying, we will be able to do that with improv, to have that connection with each other. And because through that and through this experience as well, empathy, I think is one of the biggest things and the biggest logins of this whole thing. And I think that probably I have said everything that I was supposed to say at this point. So thank you very much. -",SPEAKER_07,2013.53,2299.74,286.21,https://anchor.fm/s/debdff4/podcast/play/13465947/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-4-8%2F71293346-48000-2-f839edbfc229e.mp3,31,NO_INFERRED_ROLE,NO_INFERRED_SPEAKER,,,,

So whatever it is, and we go along with that. And the way we are, all the artists making the arts is that it would be like synchronizing with the way people live in their life. So I would think really a digital life, like we are living like a digital world. Therefore, like also we have like a teenagers grow up and adults. So how would they socialize their life or do the collection between the human being? That would impact how we make the improvisation or the art form towards that, no matter what it is. I would think at this moment, the more people we are engaging, the more ideas will come out. The new solution will come from there. I think we would trust how would that be in the future and the stick to the fact that we cannot come back to a longer life. Like we are trying to normalize it by keeping on doing what about doing, like we are meeting together. Like what also the Nick mentioned that, maybe there's a different behavior when I meet together or we're still like hesitated in the heart. Like we are wearing the masks or we're not or we have this kind of habit or we are keeping a social distance or we are not keeping that. Or like a Philippa, like we are like hugging each other or we'll think about that. So that's very tightly and subtle things we would consider. I think something different other than that, as an improviser or improv teachers, I think we would really like maybe pay attention on that. Something very, something like we are in a way we are changing ourselves. And we are like at the same time we are impacting the others. So what that would be? And well, I think it's very curious. It's very curious. Let's see. There might be a new opportunities. Maybe more like doors opened to all of us.

And I think Helen also wants to say something about it. I didn't see you mention her, so I would love to hear what she has to say. To me, this is a temporary thing, the whole online, the whole corona thing. I have a very strong belief in science in all the doctors. I think they will find a cure and then later a vaccine and this is just a temporary thing. And we can just go back to normal. And for me, that means I have the chance to do other stuff I want to do, spend more time with family. Like I said, do chores around the house. So I'm very happy with all the improvises that are doing all these improv things. Right, do it, have fun with it. Not for me, not right now. If this will go on for like five years, I'll probably change my mind. But maybe I'll just do something completely different. I don't know yet, but I'll just see when we get there. What I do notice that for me, it's harder to stay connected with online things because I think it's a chance to listen better because I'm not every time someone's saying, ""Oh yeah, I got to add this to it."" And at the same time, if someone speaks for too long, my month is one is off and I'm somewhere else. So that makes it harder. Also, I think that normally I like teachers that are more facilitated than teachers in real workshops. So not just saying, this is what I have to bring and this is the way you should do it. And I think there's a risk of doing it online where you become more of a teacher that just states things because it's harder to feel the room to interact with it. So I think that's a challenge. And I wouldn't know how to do that for myself. So that's hard. So these are my points regarding the improv online. I'm very happy that people are trying all this stuff out and well, maybe I'll join you later, not for now. But I also wanted to say something about language. I think there's a strong North American influence in improv. And it's your first language. It's not my first language. And the research shows that if you speak in a different language, you actually have a different personality because my mind is not as fast. I don't know the right word. So maybe I'm a bit more shy than I'm in Dutch. So part of my culture gets lost. And I think the risk is that if I get taught by people who teach in English, that my English improviser takes it with me. But then when I do my Dutch improvisation, I don't take it with me. So the transfer might be different. And also the other way around. So what I do in Dutch improv, I might not bring to the table when I do it in English. And I feel that there might be a risk where we all get kind of the same US, Canada style improv when we are at festivals because the English is the language there. And I don't have a solution to it, but I would love for people to really stick to their own culture. And somehow bring that along when they speak English, when they do it in a different language. So like Kaiser, I would love to see your dark finish shows. And I noticed that I find it hard to bring my Dutch improv style into English. So I really hope the people that go around teaching a lot really take this into account because that is very important to me because I love the different cultures, the different styles of improv from all around the world. So please don't become all the same, please don't. That's it for me",SPEAKER_09,2500.35,2762.05,261.7,https://anchor.fm/s/debdff4/podcast/play/13465947/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-4-8%2F71293346-48000-2-f839edbfc229e.mp3,35,NO_INFERRED_ROLE,NO_INFERRED_SPEAKER,,,,

And that is something that in the US and Canada that we don't have as much exposure to. You think about the strong history in Latin America and Spanish speaking and Portuguese and all of these influences that typically have been consumed by us to the extent it's happened in English. What can we do? Is there going to be a technological leap that will allow for that translation to happen so that it's more first language to first language in the year?

I think that's an opportunity like Felipe was saying that we can all be of service to each other in some way. We can connect people. We can just be of service by giving people attention to just say like, hey, I see you, I hear you. Let's do this jam and that's a big deal and that offers a lot of value. And I think that's a really cool thing. The other part that is so good is I'm so curious that I was so like, how am I gonna get on the ground floor to find out what's happening in so many different global issues? One of them that I was curious about was the Africans in China. How was I gonna know about how the African, the way it's portrayed on the news is one thing but I wanted to talk to somebody that was Chinese that was like in China, real life, day to day, what's their story? So I got on Tinder and I bought like a monthly account and I dropped my little thing and I dropped it in Hong Kong and I started swiping. And I can send you guys the screenshots. I got pretty lucky, I did all right. A couple of people, but one woman also got on there for the same purpose was to link up with a black person or African person to say how wrong it was. That was her whole intention. And that was my whole intention too. Was it just here from somebody who was actually there who was a human who I know has, we have no, the only reason we're coming together is Tinder during the pandemic. So we're not gonna get together like that. So the whole purpose was really just to share, our concerns about social justice issues. So I feel like we have a shortcut right to the people in these places that we have these ideas of like, oh, they're from America, they're like this. They're from Amsterdam, they're probably, we can just kind of like cut right to the people and make these like really interesting connections. Now, if she was comfortable to do like a video chat, I would love to have done that interview and then maybe have like another improvised team, you know, if I wanted to take that next step, but the heart of it was that I was genuinely curious about a thing and thank you technology and thank you, Tinder, that I was able to satisfy that.

Yeah, I really totally agree with your opinion. I also use Korean and English, and also I started with the English improv first and English teacher taught me improv. So I have two identities. I have an English improviser. I have a Korean improviser. I'm not saying characters. As an improviser, I'm very different. As an English one and Korean one. My Korean team, inflow team, watching me doing English performing, they say, whoa, is that her? It's different one, totally different. And maybe if you see my Korean version of improvising, totally different. And also I wanna say, I have experience, I use the mother tongue in front of international people twice. First, in Chicago, there were five weeks intensive and worldwide people gathered. And 16 mother tongue re-performed. And every audience was all international. And that was a magical time. They got us, they get sensing more than 70 or 80%. But in Manila festival, we performed in Korean in our team, inflow team performed in Korean in front of Filipinos audience. So they didn't get it. There were no, let me know of any reaction, any reaction interaction was not there. And after the show, they came and asked, what was the story about? And why the deaf person came back? And they didn't get it. So it was kind of, I felt like a dead performing. So it was very different. So after then, I thought about it. The difference was audience, improvisers, audience, I think they get it. They are more sensing, sensing very well. But non-improvizer audience, if their language difference or language barrier, it's really, really hard to get.
