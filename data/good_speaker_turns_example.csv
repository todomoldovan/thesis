And it's not just the millions of protesters who are pouring into the street in support of Black Lives Matter, it's not just a generation defining pandemic. We're also witnessing a change in history with a capital H. We're having conversations nationally and locally about how we recognize history and whose stories get told. Just last week, the Alabama Archives released a statement admitting that for a century, it fed the lost cause narrative of the Civil War and failed to collect narratives from Black Alabamians. We've all seen Confederate monuments, and a few others, toppled around the country. We've heard debates about Gone With the Wind and Pancake Surups and popular TV shows, and it's all happening very quickly and it may feel like a lot to absorb, but Dr. Hillary In Green is the perfect voice to walk us through this moment. Welcome back to The Reckon Interview, I'm your host John Hammanry and today I am talking with Dr. Green about monuments, reconstruction, a legacy of menstrual culture and a lot more. Dr. Green is an associate professor of history at the University of Alabama and since 2015 she has hosted campus tours to contextualize many of the buildings on campus that are named for Confederates and Klansmen. Now earlier this month, the University of Alabama removed a Confederate monument, a boulder, from the center of campus. We discuss what this action meant and now what work still needs to be done. So let's make history on this week's episode",SPEAKER_01,0.0,86.51,86.51,https://pdst.fm/e/chrt.fm/track/D33B1E/traffic.megaphone.fm/ADLM9924637739.mp3?updated=1651350594,1,host,John Hammanry,,0,0.0,Call-to-Action

My immediate reaction was, wow, it's interesting to be a part of this historical moment because if you think about it five years since Charleston, we started having these waves. And Charleston, we had that first wave. Charlottesville, we have a second, but there's something about this moment, 2020, and I think it's the pandemic and the effects of this, unfortunately, of people of color and class. I also think it's the political moment in many countries across the way and people not feeling their voices are being heard. And also, too, I think people now with questions of policing and different things and those power dynamics that were at the core of this monuments, when they first came up, people are now responding, like physically responded by pulling things down, they're going through their governments. And I think it's the combination of all of that that makes this unique.

Yeah, so I started doing this research because of a student, black male student in my class January 2015 said slavery did not exist at the University of Alabama. So kind of question why we were talking about slavery in college campuses. And then I took the university tour and I can no longer fault the student. So there was no conversations going on. There was no way to educate the students of the slave past, but also the bolder. When Charleston happened and Charlottesville happened, I had people not even know that we had that UDC Boulder on our quad. They walked by it every day and didn't see it. So it became a, this is, I can't have students in my class think slavery didn't exist and not see the kids' landscape. And then other students who are hyper aware who did not want to be at UA more, they were talking about transferring. So how to keep them there and invest it in the ball. So turn it and learn in this information, but talking about it, having those difficult conversations about it. So when I first started doing the tours and the research, I had maybe one or two people who had actually heard of the history. They had actually heard about the University of apologizing for slavery in 2004. Shorty had not. To now we, five years later, because of the tours, because of those conversations that UAs now removed the monuments, the two plaques on Gorgas Library and the bolder, the students who have taken the classes and the tours are using that language, that long history. Like, wait, we're UA too. We matter. Our voices are out there and we are the future. We are living everything in the capstone. And that was never there in five years ago.

I am kind of struck by the fact that you said a student first brought this to your attention. You know, just in the years since I've been on campus, I think of a lot of the changes that have been made. You talk about the five-year period since 2015, but you know, whether it's the desegregation of the Greek system or the election of, you know, the first black SGA president in, I think it would have been 40, 50 years when Eliot Spillers was elected.

So we might need to start thinking about narratives. How do we communicate these narratives over time? That's not this congratulatory, hey, let's put ourselves on the back, but really do that hard work of making this the inclusive space. And I think my concern is now with the moment coming down on the UA and others is when I got there, I would hear a lot. And I do still hear from some naysayers, well, we gave them a marker. And I'm like, well, who are the we and who are the they in the situation? My concern is now is we removed a marker.

You know, the University of Mississippi, they have a multiple problems that are all being addressed right now. Basically, there's the state flag, which is the last remaining flag that has the stars and bars, the most recognizable Confederate flag. That is seemingly being debated in the legislature right now. You know, by the time this episode airs, maybe there's a two flag solution. Who knows?

And one of the things why it's tone depth is creating a plaza and spending more money to another romanticized version of the lost cause. And I think the best statement came out recently over that wasn't just a visceral response to it, was that, like, wait a minute, we never agreed to this. We didn't see this. So the transparency, the openness, I could will snuck up on even those who are willing to like, okay, it's moved, we can work with solutions. And it made the battle lines even more intense now. The other is though, spending more money for a neo-confederate, neo-lost cause plaza. It ignores even the basic demands of people like, can we no longer have this presence, this monument here? So they're building a new monument. And they're actually updating the cemetery. That was never a good story. I added new stones added this. So when the history department said, like, this isn't even this change in the narratives of the lost cause that we had and create a new lost cause narrative for our campus. So how do you expect people to teach their students to come there and to attract students? And I think it's the removal on that and then the solution. The solution is going to cause the next round of the base on this campus. So I'll be very interested because it reminds me of UNC Chapel Hill with Silent Sam and how that happened.

It was actually pulled down by students after the university failed to listen to their demands, sorry, doing surveillance of students and others. And as a alum, I was a part of a movement to why not give money to the school until this got resolved. But when the monument gets pulled down, the university puts in storage and then they say, well, we're going to create a museum for this. And we're going to create this multi-million dollar museum. We're also going to have all this money for security. And we're just like, well, that's the went to scholarships. I could have done this other thing. And then the lawsuit started to happen where even sports personalities with UNCs, basketball team who are never vocal on race started talking.

It became one of those flash points that now after a lawsuit got settled, we realized that you didn't see never really owned it. Nope, we are not sure who owned it, but that's a lot of money that went to some legal suits over this monument. And it's still in storage. It has not dropped back up, but the saga continues and it's still being waged. So I think the University of Mississippi should look to that. Are you willing to have a multi-year fight on your hands?

Yeah, the UDC is the successor of the Ladies Memorial Association, which really has it starts right after the Civil War. This is women who are supporters of the Confederacy, but there's also women in the North, they're African Americans who are attending to the wartime debt. These are women dedicated to one making sure that everyone has a headstone and the preservant and taking care of those cemeteries. So they're in private spaces. So the United Daughters of the Confederacy is the successor of Reconstruction. Have it after the Americans go to school, have it after American politicians, and as Republican governments during Reconstruction are being removed and replaced by redemption, you also have to change the landscape and the cultural redemption. And this is where the LMA's that become the United Daughters of the Confederacy are important because this is the role of women and shaping the landscape by putting up monuments in public spaces to say, hey, African Americans, you no longer belong. This is our history, our space, and this is the power structure. And then also to the UDC did textbooks. So they are looking at living monuments as the children of future generations, both white and black, to learn the version of the lost cause. They are also educated every child through the textbooks that now they control. So the textbook committees are controlled by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. They also sponsored scholarships. And the other thing we are talking about are these monuments, but their legacy and the scope of their work were more than these monuments. It was textbooks, school building names, holidays, and the like. And if it wasn't for the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the LMA's, we would not have these discussions because this is the work of women who purposely and strategically made this as their political statement to shape the South and to shape the remandments of the Civil War that honored the Confederacy, that honored this lost cause, that made the men who fought into these valiant soldiers and did it in a way that had mass appeal that the reunions couldn't do, individual teaching couldn't do, but they made sure they went from the cradle to the grave. And that is why we are still talking about these monuments. And when you look at the role of the UDC in the first wave of the monument craze from 1880 to 1920, that is the work of that, those groups of women, everything else has come since. And it's usually the children who are doing it, but the UDC made their mark on society. And these debates I find it's telling that very few people remember the women who were responsible for these monuments. And we always say the UDC, lost cause, monuments, but also Jim Crow era monuments. And it's our cultural backlash and redemption of reconstruction. And it's why that period, because it's the period of lynching, it's the period of disenfranchisement. And when you overlay my students every time I teach the monuments, it's usually after talking about lynching. And I show them the Equal Justice Initiative website with the lynching map. And then a couple of lectures later, we're talking about the monuments. And I always have students who are like, ""Oh my gosh, you could do a complete overlay."" And you're seeing lynching and monuments going up at the same time. And those records going up at the same time. And with disenfranchisement, that's a part of that narrative too. And I think that's why a lot of people are protesting today, because they're seeing that long legacy of the first reconstruction now continuing to present. But also now with William Barber of North Carolina and others calling for a third reconstruction that deals with policing. They're making those through lines in that long history in ways that I would never expect it other than those college campuses that are learning this.

We spoke with Reverend Barber for an episode of this podcast last year and you know, he talked about during that period of reconstruction, you had those fusion governments of African-American politicians who were put into the reconstruction governments by the Republicans on the federal level and elected on the ground level because black Americans voting rates were obviously higher than they had ever been but also higher than they would be a few decades later. When those redemption governments seize power through intimidation, through violence and through voter fraud. And then during this period where you're talking about the UDC building these monuments, these redemption governments were also changing the constitutions themselves. I think the Birmingham's monument that was just taken down recently, I think the cornerstone was laid the same year of the 1901 Constitution right around that same time period. So a lot of this work was happening all at once. It also started to seep into popular culture in minstrelsy and another major headline we've seen recently is that Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben and Mrs. Butterworth and some of these other minstrel icon brands that have somehow endured to 2020 are now changing.

So the Mami figure, heavy set woman who took care of the enslavers children and then also to this era of blackface, mental street across the board, I will have to say blackface was national and international is not just a sub-government, churches performed blackface in the same era as this is going on. Cultural scene, it is culturally the art form of the time period. So when these advertisers are tapping into a popular culture manifestation and the Mami that safe woman who's not hyper sexual but that comfort reminds of that past of when enslaved people and African Americans were subservient. It erases those gains of reconstruction and also to people with diet. People would buy the Aunt Jemima food but then also buy the cookie jars. It all does also. So the consumption of these goods were so lucrative and I find it's interesting that consumption and consumers and marketed they will go wherever the market is. And as long as that market sustains it, you will see it continue. And so as plantations and current tours are revised to include the African American experience and being truthful about the history, now it's coming to firms like Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben because there's too much of a backlash and too many people will not buy it. They can't afford to have their product gone. So they will just respond to those market demands as plantation houses and tours have adjusted to new markets of African Americans and other people questioning the sanitized versions of the past and those that wants to promote myths of that lost cause. And which is funny because when the other monuments that the UDC did and some of the other UDC monuments had that faithful Mami on the monuments themselves. They wanted to have a faithful Mami and Mami in D.C. That myth is still prevalent, especially when you watch the run with the wind and all this other stuff.

So like the other Roosevelt alone on his horse, as he did a lot of money for the museum, we can OK with this. It's that Native American and African American behind them, when it's put up as a national scene of retrenchment on terms of Native Americans as well as African Americans. And so they're like, oh, maybe we shouldn't have these people behind us anymore. So for me, I always look at is it the lost cause? Is it something with slavery mythology? Is it settler colonialism? What's that past? And I really tried to listen to those who protest. And what are they questioning? What are they saying? And is this a way maybe if we have Ulysses S Grant, can contextualization happen or they're less like no, or the Sand Creek massacre that Eric Coleman talked about having a monument to a massacre of Native Americans, probably not a good thing to have. So the era coming up is there. So I always try to, when I teach, say it's not just this. And it's the great men myths that I'm not sure monuments are the right thing to do because all individuals are flawed. And I think what happens, and especially we're seeing with the other monuments in the Golden Gate, those were individuals who had history with Native Americans and massacres that way. I'm like, oh, so if I could see their pain and trauma and why they're like, he has to go. At the same time, they wouldn't have the same resonance with a Confederate monument because their history is not personal. The place, it's the place of the monument. Those communities that have to engage with it, it affects how they talk about it. And I always emphasize the various areas, but how place matters and how individual communities dealing with that pain and trauma will shape them to do different things because of that monument or that pass because it's more real to them. And that American mythology might work at Monticello. It might work at other places because they've been having the Congress, they've got slavery, but never about the other histories.

So, and then I grew up in Boston. So, we always did the Civil Rights Trail, so the Shawmamore was always a factor of my childhood, but every summer we got in the car and we drove to Pennsylvania and we drove to South Carolina. And on family porches, I heard about black history from, in the family history, when my dad's side of the family was enslaved, my mother's side were free. And then we always went to all the plantations, all the port something, and then I grew up in Gettysburg in the battle. We had pictures of me from stroller up to 18. And so it allowed me to one understand my family roots because my parents were exposing me to communities they were important in their life and those alternate narratives and histories about the black experience from the Civil War onwards, the Civil Rights Movement. And as the weird Boston cousin, he only came down twice a year. Like the healthy realized where I was coming from and with the Civil War and slavery was the unifier. That's why I really studied the Civil War and more so Reconstruction because slavery is hard even for me to talk about and understand. But I knew that because of Reconstruction, because of emancipation, that helped contribute to my parents meeting all this other stuff in this changed history. So, I wanted to talk about freedom and what that looked like and the institutions that the churches I went to in Charleston and Pennsylvania that had their time period from there. What was going on in the process that and I can go back to Massachusetts like, okay, we know post abolition racism is still here, but how do they have this abolitionist past into this all of this. So it allowed me to grow up and find my place and identity as someone from Boston with these two divergent roots. And as a historian, I'm just amazed of what was built by people coming up with nothing. And those institutions as values and what freedom look like and the hope that they had in spite of everything. And I'm like, I might need to tap into that. Who are these everyday men, women and children who come in all this moment, like we succeeded, we've done everything. Let's shape America. That's the way everyone is doing. Let's shape our communities. And that I think is one of the things that continues to need to go back to. How do they maintain that hope? They didn't know Jim Crow was coming, but yet they are fighting. They are living. They are creating meaningful laws and institutions, some of which I still see today. They were institutional builders in a way that I don't think we think about with Reconstruction. It's like Eric Boner talks about this as the second founding.
