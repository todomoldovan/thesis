Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the ""starry-eyed internationalists"" who urged disarmament and who longed for a ""world state"" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.",postnationalist,Awareness,None,,None,0,"[0.9995248402654973, 5.182371097196488e-05, 5.003343766966853e-05, 2.250783363801273e-05, 0.00035079475222300283]"
