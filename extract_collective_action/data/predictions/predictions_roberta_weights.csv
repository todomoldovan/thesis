Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the ""starry-eyed internationalists"" who urged disarmament and who longed for a ""world state"" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.",postnationalist,Awareness,None,,None,0,"[0.9978093512043188, 0.0003317986946785207, 0.0004697425100810022, 0.0004033646306993644, 0.0009857429602222639]"
