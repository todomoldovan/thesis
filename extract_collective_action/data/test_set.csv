jrl2kv3,antiwork,"My problem with my college experience is that most of my classes were taught by other students. In a lot of cases, they didn't understand the course material. Through the last couple years, I had a full time job in IT, and I would literally show up to class and have to explain to the instructor how things worked. And, I paid a lot of money for that. In one class, it was a tenured professor that I an another student had to explain things to. He would struggle for a few minutes to figure out how to do something, we would show him, and then he would dismiss us (maybe 15 minutes into class) because he didn't want us getting ahead of the other class. A few months after one of my classes where this happened, I got to interview the instructor for a job at the company I worked for... I had some good instructors in college, but they were kinda few and far between. Mostly they were either highlevel undergrad or grad students who barely understood the content, or they were newly hired professors that really had no business teaching. It would maybe be fine if I didn't have to pay so damn much money for the experience, but I truly believe that if you are going to spend (at this point) hundreds of thousands on an education, they people delivering that education should actually be qualified to teach.","In one class, it was a tenured professor that I an another student had to explain things to.

I've brought up plenty, you just brush off human rights abuses as being human rights abuses instead of wage related, as if they're mutually exclusive. Seriously, you want to talk about logic? How about the false dilemma fallacy? Because your entire argument rests on one. Well, that and another one: begging the question. And the question is, what good is employment if the results are worse than being unemployed? Because that's the only unemployment a minimum wage can cause. Putting bastards whose heads belong on pikes for treating their slaves -- excuse me, ""employees"" -- so horrifically out of business is a public service, not a crime. And in reality they don't go out of business, they just suck it up and take a paycut themselves because their employees bring in plenty of money, they just begrudge granting them even the tiniest bit of the fruits of their own labor. Simply having a job is not necessarily a good thing. Literal slaves had jobs. No job can be meaningfully called good if it doesn't *at least* result in better quality of life than what slaves had to deal with. And without a minimum wage, you get the opposite.

ezw44it,antiwork,"I agree in sentiment of course; jobs should not be peoples' entire lives. However I think asking 'was his job really worth his life?' is glossing over some of the context. He had PTSD and anxiety from his previous experience being held at gunpoint. He was acting entirely morally and in the right when he tried to stop the thief yet he was still punished for it. He lost his job that he used to support his family. All these things compounded on each other until the guilt, shame, anger and confusion were too much to handle and he took his own life. Some people are more resilient to psychological trauma and some are less so. Unfortunately for this man it seems he was one of the latter, through no fault of his own, it's just how his brain worked. It's easy to say that a job isn't worth your life when you already firmly believe it and you have no confounding circumstances. However, this guy was 49 and worked as a cashier, losing what little you have and knowing you have family to support can be heart-wrenching. What will you tell them? How will you make ends meet? The poor guy probably wouldn't even be able to get another cashier job again when competing against young people who need part time work and also having been fired for disregarding company policy. His financial, moral and social world collapsed around him and he saw one way out. He was a victim of his environment - everything that happened was out of his control. You could argue that him trying to stop the shoplifter was within his control, but was it really? When people see crimes being committed they generally either freeze up, run away or jump in and try to help/stop it. Nobody contemplates whether they should help or not, it's human nature, fight, flight or fright. He was punished for being a moral agent. I can't imagine being betrayed by the world like that and it makes me sad that he had to.","He was acting entirely morally and in the right when he tried to stop the thief yet he was still punished for it.

k9ea5cu,EndFPTP,"There are two benefits. One benefit is that tactical voting can be exploited (easily) if the ""overvotes"" are counted as if they are counted approval-like. In a situation where the best tactic is not obvious, software (artificial intelligence if necessary) can calculate the best tactic (based on reasonably accurate poll results). The other benefit is that ignoring the ballots when the ""overvotes"" are reached weakens support for those marked candidates, which makes it easier for a less-popular candidate to avoid elimination. Regarding the second benefit, perhaps it's helpful to consider the stadium metaphor with 20 voters marking the same two candidates at the same preference level. That would mean that 10 of those voters stand in line to support one of the two candidates, and the other 10 voters stand in line to support the other candidate. That extra support could cause yet another candidate to have the shortest line. If instead those 20 voters did not stand in any line, one of the two same-ranked candidates can end up with the shortest line. In other words, in a close race where every vote counts, counting the overvotes instead of ignoring them can correct what otherwise would be the wrong elimination. I thought this interpretation was obvious, hence the misunderstanding about (unintentionally) not answering your question.","That would mean that 10 of those voters stand in line to support one of the two candidates, and the other 10 voters stand in line to support the other candidate.

k0gyrga,EndFPTP,"Just quickly going through it: * It constantly conflates RCV with IRV which isn't great because IRV is not the only (and far from the best) RCV voting method * IRV can allow tied rankings * I disagree with the voting systems need to be able to denote intensity of preferences part because I don't think you can do that without introducing a lot of strategizing. In any voting system you need to limit the total ""intensity of preference"" that a ballot can contain (so you cant score your favorite ∞) . Most of these systems do that by limiting the sum of all intensities to some upper bound (here I'm interpreting giving 5 points to A and 3 points to B as giving 2 points to your opinion A>B). This always leads to situations where it's rational give more of your allotted intensity budget to those opinions which are more likely to be relevant. If your preferences are A >> B > C >> D >>>>> E, but both A and E probably won't be elected, why waste points on the A >> B or D >..> E part. That would lead to your opinion on B > C >> D counting less. * Lesser evil will happen in all single winner elections * idk about the partisanship campaigning part, might be true * ranked ballots are more intricate, but too many candidates doesn't work well with any system (because there's only so many politicians you can remember). Also the effort required to honestly fill out a ranked ballot is only n\*log(n) ;) * The concerning example is not great for IRV, B is the condorcet winner, but in practice these situations rarely happens (I don't remember the numbers, but IRV only fails to elect a condorcet winner in \~1-2% of elections) Also it's kind of funny that in the corresponding star ballots, 1&2 could bury B and make A win the runoff against C.

hxp0bqe,EndFPTP,"No “woman” told me anything. It’s immediately obvious that approval voting reduces to FPTP, which is probably why it’s almost never been implemented. Everyone understands the strategic voting of only voting for your favorite (or the nearest who you think you can win, same as FPTP) because voting for anyone else dilutes your vote for your favorite, actually harming them. With RCV, you can never harm a candidate you like. LOL at your assertion that changing a voting system is so easy. If that were so, it would happen often and always win. You have clearly never been involved in a a campaign. Now bills are being passed to prevent electoral reform. So easy, you guyz.","If that were so, it would happen often and always win.

g5e521r,EndFPTP,"Condorcet methods have problems but that has nothing to do with the conversation. It does, because we're talking about the chicken dilemma. In Condorcet, Blackberry can win even if **0%** of the voters view Blackberry as a first choice. The fact you had to force an adjustment from 0% approval to 40% approval confirms my point that it's not a real chicken dilemma.  Let’s build on your hypo. Let’s say Blackberry is the first choice of 40% of the population. Let’s say 35% prefer A1 and 25% prefer A2 and all 60% of the A voters HATE Blackberry. But approval is not meant to create a distinction between love, like, dislike, and hate. It's instead either like or dislike specifically. Either you like the possibility of a Blackberry victory, or you don't like it. If 0% of the voters like the idea of a Blackberry victory, then Blackberry would never win, even if 100% of the voters decided to vote strategically by bullet voting. Blackberry only wins when more voters like it if Blackberry wins (and when fewer voters dislike it if Blackberry wins). You're criticizing approval voting for not doing something it wasn't intended to do anyways. What **is** intended to do, it does fine.  It depends on too fucking much It depends on a simple question: do you like the possibility of a candidate being the winner, or do you dislike that possibility? If you truly like it when a candidate gets the victory, then there's no reason to refuse approval to that candidate.  IRV will get you the best outcome 98-99% of the time and is the most resistant to strategy, and will probably never get you the worst outcome. Now look at who's being cult like. Just pulling numbers out of thin air. With IRV, you don't need to vote strategically to get bad outcomes, making its strategy resistance meaningless. Even honest votes are vulnerable to spoilers (again, because of IIA and ISDA being violated) and minority rule (since the Condorcet winner can be rejected; apprpval makes up for that by never letting a minority approved candidate defeat a majority approved candidate, which still isn't the case with IRV. Even with honest votes). Even an honest vote for **any** candidate backfire because of the Participation criterion.  Approval Voting can behave very very similarly to plurality voting if voters don’t approve of multiple candidates. Yes, similarly. Not the same. When everyone bullet votes in approval voting, the candidates favored by the most voters is the winning candidate. Green voters will vote for the Green candidate, Dems will vote for the Democrat candidate, Republicans will vote for the Republican, etc. That's not what happens in plurality (where Green voters instead decide to dishonesty say they top prefer Democrat, which also happens in IRV).","Just pulling numbers out of thin air.

eibjfcx,EndFPTP,"Yes you are missing that parties, lobbyists, the media, interest groups, friends and family have educated voters about Approval strategy. This has nothing to do with it. This applies even if they are fully educated as to Approval strategy, and being fully strategic. The only requirement is that they not have 100% certainty of who the two front runners are.  You are assuming far too much bullet voting. I am not suggesting they are bullet voting because they are uncomfortable with Approval or that they ""always bullet vote"". I am suggesting many of them ""bullet vote"" because they rationally and correctly think it is the best strategy for them in this particular election given their preferences and assessment of who is likely to be front runners. Approving only one is often a good strategy, such as if you prefer that candidate to all other candidates, and they are one of the two front runners. (which, in a 3 person election should happen as often as it not happening, right?) Note also that this example is only 3 candidates, if it was, say, 7, we might be talking about the difference between voting for, 3 candidates and 4 candidates. This isn't ""bullet voting"" so much as it is ""reducing the number of approved candidates because it makes sense to do so based on your preferences and your estimation of who might be front runners."" Are you suggesting that to do Approval most strategically, you should always approve two candidates if 3 are running? It sort of sounds like you are, but that is obviously not true...  A voter who is close to B and C is only going to cast a {B} or {C} ballot if they very sure that A is non-viable No, because some of those voters will be significantly closer to B or C. All they have to think is that the race ***might*** come down to B and C, and they feel strongly enough about their preference for one of those two, that they want to express their preference between them. This does not require 100% certainty that it will be down to those two, only a non-zero probability. Note that a perfectly rational voter will factor in probability as well as their strength of preference. Note also that if the voter has not observed any polling, they won't have any way of knowing who the front runners are likely to be. I live in San Francisco where there has been ranked choice for a long time, and on 90% of the ballots, I have no clue who is leading. And I'm sure I am more educated than most people. If it was Approval, I would be taking stabs in the dark as to where to set the threshold for Approval.  Mostly if the voters don't have good probability data then they can assume probabilities are equal. I'm not sure that's the case, but if it is, that exactly is where Duverger's law is in maximum effect. If people have no idea who is in the lead, Approval is absolutely subject to vote splitting. This seems rather obvious (especially if you take some time to look at/think about the images I posted). Do I have to make a javascripted web app to demonstrate it? (I remember last time I was participating here a year ago, I did so to demonstrate that average and mean were very different in a numerical election, which seemed equally trivially obvious but a bunch of people argued with me till I demoed it: [ ) I don't have time right now to demonstrate this with an interactive demo, but I guess I will eventually if needed.  #x200B;","Yes you are missing that parties, lobbyists, the media, interest groups, friends and family have educated voters about Approval strategy.

But to be creative and productive doesn't not require ideologies rooted in evil.   If the issue is crime then charge them with the physical crime not the thought crime. When thoughts are published and expressed they are no longer thoughts. We're not talking about people who dropped an N bomb once or someone expressing their admiration for aspects of Nazism but rather individuals and groups who have repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to pursuing and spreading those ideals.  You are talking about most of the founders and most of the members of Western Civilization (as well as almost all the others) through all time. Not entirely. Context is important here. The further we go back the further we separate ourselves from the benefits of modern science. It is one thing to be deceived in to believing religion when there is an absence of quality information available. It is entirely another to have the benefits of our era and still believe that which one would otherwise not.   You keep making your definition broad and narrow and switching.

Yes and they also had cars back then but no one in their right mind would equate the sophistication of today's designs with that of the those in 1918. The quantity and quality of the psychological assaults that exist today are light years beyond what existed then.   Not really. High quality individuals in a system that is designed to deadlock without consensus elected by a highly polarized electorate deadlock. The problem is not the lack of quality of the individuals, the problem is the electorate is polarized. Yes really. If this were not the case then we'd have heard large groups of politicians calling for reform in a system that is no longer optimal for our times. It has failed to evolve along with the rest of the country. Instead they keep propping up this decrepit system because no one wants to be the first politician to suffer the initial blowback from saying what must be said. Both parties are filled politicians who have little to no desire to break the traditional structures the encourage subservience to big money corporate and private donors. Their gifts are not that they are wise and visionary leaders but that they know how to get elected and have mastered the art of making sounds with their mouths but not actually saying anything of substance. And so long as they don't get caught up in a sex scandal and manage to vote whatever way the political wind happens to be blowing in their constituency they'll likely keep getting reelected.

jlv8u3s,antiwar,">You are welcome to believe what you have written in the essay you just typed me but most of the world doesn't agree with you and your blustering rhetoric wont change that. Convenient way to ignore everything I just said. As for India, their support for the invasion should be scrutinized both for its scale and reasoning. Like you said, the country is huge and also has institutionalized class divide, polls are likely to be unreliable. So I think its questionable how many actually ""support"" the invasion like you claim, vs how many support ties with Russia for unrelated reasons. I can't comment on the article you linked because its behind a paywall. However I will say that India's passive support for Russia is both misunderstood and overblown. There will of course always be the loud minority of radicals as in every country, but generally speaking its for more pragmatic reasons. Russia provides cheap oil and arms, and a minor assurance that China won't attack them. Thats all. India is already seeking other arms sources with better quality, and the oil thing will always be temporary as soon as a higher paying buyer shows up. An outright military alliance between them, China, and Russia however is unlikely, due to the former's aggression and ties with Pakistan. I mean ffs China literally has sends guys over to capture territory and they end up duking it out with Indian guys with sticks. Not the healthiest relationship. Speaking of China, their support for Russia's war is insanely passive and non-committal considering they are well, China (FYI I will mostly be talking about their government, rather than their public, because if we're being honest public opinion isn't worth a dime in China). They abstained from the UN votes and haven't provided any significant military aid to them as far as we can tell. They will of course keep up the anti-west rhetoric and say the usual stuff, but generally speaking are not keen on Russia conducting such escapades. They need the world to remain politically inactive and uninterested in world affairs, and Russia has thrown that concept out the window. The war also raises the uncomfortable notion that regions of countries should be able to leave if they want to and if a foreign power supports them *\*cough Taiwan cough\*.* By triggering a resurgence in NATO unity and support, whilst weakening themselves, Russia has actually complicated China's geopolitical goals. A hypothetical war with the US will now be much more risky, and their entire theory of Soviet military technology, command structure, and western response is now on shaky ground. >In China as well as India the answer is Russia not the US should get to decide just like China not the US should get to decide what goes in Taiwan etc. You're completely missing the point and/or living a fantasy yourself. The point isn't that only US or Russia can decide, the point is that Ukraine decides. And Ukraine clearly does not want to be with Russia, nor Taiwan with China. They are within their respective rights to seek alliances with others who will defend their sovereignty. The so called ""realist"" view of the world is a relic of the Cold War and is no longer relevant. Implementing this world in the modern day will only lead to more wars, calamity, invasions, human rights abuses, and general chaos. Russia has no more of a right to invade Ukraine than the US does Mexico. And yes, even if Mexico sought an alliance with China or Russia, I would still condemn any military intervention. >Because they didn't like the Cubans making a military alliance with the Russians, no sir. Speaking of L.A., its always funny to me when people mention the Cuban thing as if it somehow excuses this entire issue. Did everyone conveniently forget that the US ended up deciding not to invade Cuba? Yes the Bay of Pigs coup attempt happened, but coup attempts =/= invasions. We sorted out the missile issue, and that was it. And this was the ACTUAL COLD WAR mind you, when tensions then made the current issues now look like a PTA meeting. When the US actually was seriously involved in coups, subversion and etc. So, my question is this: if the coked-up, rage-fueled, schizophrenic, spooky 1960s USA can be the bigger man, and negotiate things rationally, why can't modern day Russia? >None of the major emerging economies want the US in their back yard and the US is a much greater threat and problem than 'dictators'. Rather convenient that the loudest opponents of US aid, cooperation, and military alliances are indeed dictatorships like the PRC, DPRK, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, etc. >So in the 90's, or at any point subsequent, the US could have said 'NATO will never accept any new members, we the US will veto any and all applications because we have that right"" Because the former Soviet block *wanted in*. They could already see the writing on the wall for their independence the moment Russia got back on its feet again, and knew that neutrality would ensure hostile takeover. NATO wanted to prevent this and ensure that Europe remained at peace. For decades the US and its allies was forced to watch helplessly as refugees tried to flee their countries, only to be gunned down by their 'protectors'. They watched as tanks rolled in anytime a Warsaw Pact country showed an ounce of thought or independence (Hungary, Czezhoslovakia). They watched as walls went up, as human rights were crushed, as bread disappeared. They wanted to prevent this 50 year tragedy from happening again. >How come they didn't follow the minsk agreements? They literally followed the first one until the chucklenuts in Russia and the DPR started new offensives into the Airport and other suburbs. They kept the second one and withdrew all heavy weapons from the area as required, and cancelled all plans of retaking the regions. All violations after this point were minor, and not the result of top down decisions but by the sporadic chaos that inevitably results from two trenches of soldiers with AKs pointed at each other. There's also reason to believe that Russian/DPR forces deliberately started shelling and shooting incidents to trigger a response and then blame the Ukrainians. The Minsk Agreements in general were honestly really unfair to Ukraine, basically forcing them to cede their own territory to the obvious proxies of a hostile neighbor, change their own constitution for some reason. All the while Russia laughed in the corner like a school bully because the Minsk agreements required them to do jackshite. Edit: Also, ""because Ukraine deserves it and needs to be punished."" I would pay money to see you say that, in-person, to the face of a Ukrainian rape victim, or a Mariupol nurse who cared for a child that died in their arms, or a Bucha resident who watched their brother get dragged away and shot, or a Bakhmut resident who had to flee whilst artillery deliberately targeted them, or a Kherson resident that endured months of occupation.","Like you said, the country is huge and also has institutionalized class divide, polls are likely to be unreliable.

ih7jn7d,troubledteens,"I am deeply unsettled by this post. Daniel Mackler is not someone I think anyone here should be listening to. Sure, he's an LCSW in New York, but he's also on a website shilling his special version of ""self-therapy"" and openly states he is no longer practicing as a therapist despite maintaining an active LCSW license. He openly states on his channel that disorders cannot be genetic, can be cured without medication, and pushes an anti-establishment rhetoric that is dangerously close to pure pseudo-science. He has video titles such as: * Why I am so skeptical about modern science * Bullshit (The anti-psychiatry anti-medication song) * Successful Treatment for Psychosis in West Africa (Where he straight up pushes an herbal remedy) * Psychiatric Medication Dangers Music Video -- Little Bottles (Where he parodies the song Little Boxes by using the ""chemicals"" scare tactic used by snake oil salesmen around the world. He attacks scientific methodology but then uses BAD scientific methodology. He purports to be able to cure uncurable conditions and then attacks Big Pharma. If he started talking about Xenu or thetans he'd be indistinguishable from a Scientologist. His scholarly credits are all but non-existent. For someone keeps claiming to have all the answers, the bulk of these cures can only be found in hour long YouTube videos and exhaustive texts or films that all circle around the same fallacies as the rest of the anti-psych woo woo community. His fans will flood comment sections speaking about how brilliant and profound he is. And quite frankly his methodology is perfect. He caters to the ego of people who are hurt and have experienced abuse either at home or in the system. It might be comforting to hear what he has to say. It might give some people comfort to engage his content. But that alone is not enough to justify the dangerously misinformed and potentially delusional content he makes. Medication saves lives. I would be dead today if not for anti-depressants. That's not an exaggeration. Short of taking a pill every morning to regulate my depression my brain is flooded with suicidal ideation and thoughts. I have a friend who is Schizophrenic and without medication she suffers from overwhelming and inescapable delusions. And what's worse, we are have had to pull her away from men like Mackler who tell her she can cure her Schizophrenia if she just stops taking her medication. Children might deserve excellent parents, but some parents are just bad people. No amount of Daniel Mackler talking to my father is going to stop the man from being a narcissistic pedophile.

g1t2myv,troubledteens,"You have left out an interesting concept--regulation as a pathway to criminalization. Consider Operation Rescue and the radical anti-abortion protestors of the 1980s. Abortion was routinely provided in doctor's offices at an affordable price in the 1970s across the country. When anti-abortion thugs started chaining themselves to doctor's office equipment and picketing their office landlords, they successfully drove the procedure out of the medical mainstream to free standing clinics which were easier to picket and harass even further. As they started getting elected to state legislatures in the 1994 Republican wave election, they quickly began enacting TRAAP legislation (targeted restrictions against abortion providers). This included lengthy waiting periods, parental consent laws, public reporting of abortion provider information, mandating clinics meet the tougher building standards of ambulatory surgical clinics, and requirements that abortion providers have hospital privileges at a nearby hospital. This closed nearly every abortion clinic in the country and drove up the cost to the patient considerably. The key here is that they played up to the public's distaste with the procedure as a way of getting the camel's nose under the tent. Then they passed legislation guaranteed to make the right of abortion meaningless by placing the use of the right out of reach. This is why Congressman Miller's bill terrifies the TTI shills so much. At its core it requires all TTI employees to report abuse of the patients to the authorities and to provide periodic training of what constitutes abuse. That training could provide staffers with real knowledge of what damage they are doing IF the curriculum were written by folks active in our movement, if only behind the scenes. Consider this: so many of these employees are college interns and recent college graduates or have no training in mental health at all. They believe what their employer tells them to believe largely because they know no better. The one who live in the sticks in Utah or some God-forsaken hell hole state in the Rockies do not have any other employment opportunities are doubly incentivized to pretend not to notice abuse of patients accordingly. But if they have to hear the message every year that what the practice is doing is criminal and that they must report it to authorities to avoid criminal prosecution (even if they are not doing those things) at least some of them will report and then we move on to the next phase. The almost total exemption of these places from regular, unannounced state inspection of mental health facilities is a huge problem. Not having to rise to the standards of mental health facilities allows blocks mentally ill patients from getting appropriate care. That these places line the owners’ pocket with exorbitant fees while providing sub-par care is known to us but largely not to anyone else. So why not use the inevitable scandals that reporters will be writing about (see the stories in The Missoulian that got the Montana Legislature to crack down) to push our own agenda into public law? Require that these facilities must meet the legal standards of psychiatric hospitals. Those facilities are not cheap to build or maintain. This would drive up the cost even more and help kill off the industry. Staffing is something of particular concern. In the abortion example, only licensed doctors have been allowed to perform abortions since Roe v Wade even though most physician assistant’s and even registered nurses could be trained to perform the most-commonly first trimester procedure. Doctors charge more than other health care providers in large part because there are so many fewer of them. Their small number makes them easier to intimidate, as well. Why not require by law that these places have a psychiatrist on site 24-7-365? There are very few of them and they will likely not want to take a low paid position in some tiny town in the Mormon West. No psychiatrist on site constantly, no license. Require X number of registered nurses on site for every Y number of patients just to drive up the cost under the guise of maintaining patient care. Profits are really getting squeezed now. As the industry protests, we move to force all of these places to incorporate as a non-profit under federal tax law. Skirting the non-profit requirement would then get owners in hot water with the IRS and land them in prison for tax fraud. With the ability to make a profit gone most of these places would close. The few that could survive would be nature have to move to large urban centers where medical staff would prefer to work and provide facilities and programming that are medically appropriate to young patients with mental health problems. These urban areas have a lot of reporters looking to write about a juicy scandal and the circle begins anew. And this doesn’t even begin to touch what having a requirement that patients have access to call regulatory authorities free from staff interference would do. Psychiatric hospitals have that requirement and knowing you could get your ass handed to you on a platter for gaslighting and other abuse would have the same effect on TTI staff as it does on legit mental health staff. And why not having a form of training for patients about their rights? Why not require programs to provide a state-produced pamphlet spelling out that these places are known for abuse, the types of abuse patients are likely to experience, and their legal rights for recourse including any criminal penalties against staff who harm them. Banning gooning? Possible. Requiring a court order to place a minor in a program with court monitoring of treatment and constantly asking when the release date is? Possible. A national registry of staffers to help prevent abusive staff from turning up in different programs in different states? Possible. Enough restrictions built layer by layer could destroy this industry for good.",You have left out an interesting concept--regulation as a pathway to criminalization.

jm7uyjg,troubledteens,"I am a former student of CALO I was there from 9/21/21 - 1/13/23, about 16 months. I’m sad to say not mush has changed. Some has (not always for the good sadly) there is slightly better staff, far less abuse and SA to my knowledge, although most have that “respect your authority figure” attitude some far more extreme than others. Still severely understaffed. Security is far higher and they started noticeably excepting higher risk students even from when I got there to the time I left. Several students would consistently attack other students or would regularly SH in front of other students and staff, and not much was done, but when something was done, it was very extreme. There were a few riots throughout my stay on girls side. Three girls in a safety team broke apart a bed frame and stabbed 3 staff with them, they had to be taken to the ER. So many other instances, like this of just pure violence. So a lot of issues are between students instead of staff now. For further context, I have never been a risk to myself or others but was always put in this environment, it was very unhealthy for me. I’m not sure what the campus layout was for you but now the girls side is in the two independent buildings to the left when you drive down the hill. So during times of need, it was harder to get extra staff to come in time because we were so far from the main building. There is not a single door that is not locked, all internal doors have keys, exterior doors have mag locks. Team home doors to the foyers are locked from the inside. Meaning you cannot get out but you can get in. Most of the time the emergency fire exit doors don’t pop open when you pull the alarm meaning several times kids have pulled them to get out and only some open. I was quite literally trapped down there with the fire alarms blaring for at least 10 minutes with two other kids two times on the same night with no staff in sight. Bullying was also another issue. Students could bleach other so severely that they would try and hurt themselves but they would get no consequence because they were not allowed to punish behavioral problems, Not a “clinical” problem. A few months before my 17th birthday I was moved to the girls transition house, best thing that happened to me the entire time. Luckily enough I was able to move up with my best friend that I had made there but it’s so sad that they were so desperate to move kids up that they had to put a 16 year old in there, they had to apply for a special variance because I was under the age of their policy. But moral of the story, they’re still many things I need to be worked out before the program can actually “ heal“their students. Even my therapist that I’m seeing now it’s OK with me talking about Calo whenever I want to because she understands that it was so traumatic for me to see people constantly attack each other and harm them selves and just endure the ruthless is that people would push my way, even though I constantly minded my business, I was kind to everyone.

I was told I can't ever speak without asking permission. In order to do so, I had to raise my two fingers and wait for a staff member to acknowledge my desire to speak before I can open my mouth. This applied to talking to any of the peers within my group of 8 other kids. I couldn't ask anyone personal questions or anything along the lines of ""what music do you like"" but could only converse about task-related activities such as ""can you please use your pickaxe to soften up the ground here"" (we dug a lot of trenches). If you didn't abide by that rule, you lose your ability to speak for a certain amount of time and could only communicate with staff and peers by writing it down. I have never felt as isolated before as I had in that place. I was the only drug addict in my group. The rest of my peers had severe mental issues and a breakdown would occur once every few days. The table my food was on would randomly get flipped, kids constantly needing to be restrained, runaways, etc. Kids would do the craziest things to try and hurt themselves. Find rocks that were sharp enough to cut themselves with or deliberately trying to over-hydrate. They would then be watched a lot more closely, had to wear ankle bracelets, had to be monitored when using the stalls, or even put on a leash tied around their hand. There was absolutely no privacy whatsoever. Everything we did, we did as a group. If one had to use the bathroom, we would all go and we'd have four minutes to get everything done. I had bowel problems my whole life and had issues using public bathrooms so this was especially bad for me. I usually take a good 10-15 minutes to poop but sadly, I didn't possess such prerogatives here. I ended up always feeling like I had to shit and when having the chance, never having the satisfaction of feeling like I was ""entirely cleaned out"". It also didn't help that I was reprimanded for ""purposely slowing down the group"" by always proposing the maximum amount of time available which was 4 minutes. I was written up for it because ""who needs to go #2 8 times a day"". The nurses solution to this, like with everything, was to drink more water. This issue ended up extending my ""graduation date"" by 5 weeks. I was also drastically underfed. It was a tight diet and I'm naturally a very lean person and always have been but I just never felt like I was getting enough food. On the Fourth of July, we were given hamburgers and you can choose 2 packets of condiments and after observing which had the highest calorie count, I went with two packets of mayo even though I'm way more of a ketchup and mustard on a burger guy (seriously, who tf puts mayo on a burger?) I had practically zero contact with the outside world when I was there. No phone calls with the family was allowed. My only way of contacting them was through letters. First two weeks, you weren't allowed to write them at all. At the first opportunity to do so, I wrote them a 4 page letter, begging them to take me out and stating all the ways in which my rights are being violated and how terrible of a place this is. 2 days later, I was called in to discuss the letter that I wrote and was told that they will not tolerate further ""manipulation of my parents to get what I want"" and that they aren't going to be sending this out. Was told that if I continue writing letters like this, I will have a hard time ""graduating"" from the program. There were four stages you needed to pass in order to graduate. The program on average took around 8 months to pass. Some kids took over a year and a half to attain all 4 stages. I was docile as compared to the other kids, so after the initial rebelliousness of the first month and once I've adapted to the regimen, I moved by pretty quickly. The hardest was stage three in which you were seen as a ""leader"" to the other kids and the only way to move past the stage is to consistently ""hold your peers accountable"". That means if someone said something without asking permission and the staff member didn't notice, I'm supposed to call that person out and report them. It was the hardest thing to do and I always felt super guilty doing it. All of us are just trying to do our best to get out of that place as soon as possible yet slip ups do happen. It felt super shitty to have to snitch on my peers, knowingly extending their release date just so I could ""graduate"". I've seen kids who were model residents for 5 months straight, get reprimanded for something stupid and go crazy, having been reverted back to stage 1. Was really sad to see. The only time of the day I got to enjoy was when I got to read books during my summer reading program. It was essentially my only means of escapism from that shithole. Fuckn hell, even reading the Bible was better than having to deal with the everyday monotony of being in that place. I say a juvenile detention center is better than these religious residential facilities is because in juvy, one is able to build relationships with their peers and decide what to do while incarcerated such as read books or play cards, etc. You're able to possess at least a modicum of autonomy. Not in those place however. You have no such privilege. It's still operational by the way, its called ""Elk River Wilderness Challenge"". I still have flashbacks from time to time about it. I also did not end up staying off the drugs once I got out. On a happy note though, I'm currently one and a half year sober and am going to university. Got sober through a 12 step program and meetings. If your child has substance abuse issues or alcoholism, please do not send them to any of these places. They'll end up worse off than they came in.”",Please do something. Perhaps show your son and daughter-in-law this post.,None,None

jvwreiz,troubledteens,"There was a level system. Our levels were O (Orientation), S, P, A, R, K. They all stood for something, but I’m blanking on what each individual one meant at the moment. We’d gain privileges as we got to higher letters (e.g video game time, being able to bring our personal devices, on-campus jobs, and even off-campus jobs if we were on R or K.) On O, S, and P the main focus for students was to work on their emotional regulation. When they got to A, that’s when the focus would switch to Executive function. Most kids could leave or were getting close to program completing when they got to A. It really depended on the person though. We didn’t get to interact with Elevate much. Only in passing, if we saw them in shared facilities on campus like the gym or field. However, both Spark and Elevate could participate in the school plays and we’d get to talk to eachother then. The school was alright. Most of the teachers were super kind, however I felt like I didn’t learn much. Everything was done as such a slow pace. It was really easy for me to make up credits and get good grades there because of the small workload. I know some other kids struggled and I have a different background as I went to an ambitious public school in the Bay Area, but overall the schooling wasn’t very challenging nor educational. But, it gave me a way to earn a couple semesters worth of credits in a few weeks, so I can't really complain about that. It wasn’t restraint free but holds weren’t super common. They’d only occur if a kid was trying to harm themselves, someone else, or AOWLing. I think I saw 1 my entire stay. There were obviously more holds, but I was lucky to not see them. Most didn’t seem excessive or unneeded, however there were times that both student and staff got seriously hurt and nothing happened which was frustrating.

cd0g3d6,troubledteens,"Well, crazy camps like Elan and Synonan were in fact the same branch of a much larger and far older tree. Dallas Salesmen Club had an RTC out in the woods of Texas before either of those facilities opened. Orphanages, military schools, and Indian schools had been around for much longer. People haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to religious based insitutions. We need to tread very carefully with programs and attributing a common ancestor to them. Child abuse, thought reform, and cohercion has a very long and sad history within the greater audience of humanity. Every since cavemen started kicking each other's asses for the best spot next to the fire and the best cuts of mastadon meat we've had cruelty and abuse. Programs are one very sick subset of the larger human tendency to learn towards conforming with the perpetuation of cruelty against others. I know I bought the whole sick gimmick working for Three Springs.

d1mor3j,troubledteens,"I will be honest here. Most the people in this reddit have terrible experience with programs. There are countless people here who were abused, molested, and in many ways, tortured. Programs do not tell you everything. Note how all the testimonials never say anything negative. When you visit the facility, you meet with students working the program. They can't say bad things because it is considered run plans. Mail is read and regulated. When they show staff, they only name the professionals and not the day and night staff. My best suggestion is move to a small town, avoid Montana. The only problem whose risks are obvious would be Wilderness. This is still not a nice place, but you can't find drugs in a wilderness. Wilderness is essentially camping outside in nature for a couple months. Food and hygiene is limited and everyone returns skinny and smelly. More risks than you can count. Lockdown indoor programs are strict. The staff are trained to be able to subdue violent teens and sometimes use excessive force. I was held down by three men for several hours because I hit a wall. I was bleeding from my ear. Compared to some, my experience was favorable. Here is a poet that speaks well on things.  Programs have one of many results, but the most common. 1. I works and they live a productive life. 2. It doesn't and your child doesn't speak to you and his trust in you is shattered. There has been kids to die in the program and some to commit suicide. I support the concept of programs, a better alternative to prison. But very few, if any, can be 100% trusted.","There are countless people here who were abused, molested, and in many ways, tortured.

chjafqi,troubledteens,"Thank you for posting this and thank you for being one of the good counselors actually trying to make a difference. I went to a RTC when I was 14 for 9 months and while most of the counselors I knew were fucked and the way the program was set up was fucked (it was shut down), I'm really glad I went through a crappy situation because it changed my life around for the better...

ias9yn4,troubledteens,"Oh my god I have been looking everywhere for a place to talk about mountain valley. \[incoming long post, sorry but I have ALOT\] I was forcefully transported there in late 2019 with absolutely no notice. Literally mid-breakup with my online bf (lol) and two women walked in and told me they had to restrain me if I didn't go with them. I have a panic disorder (which is unfortunately misdiagnosed as generalized anxiety despite panic attacks all the time everyday throughout childhood). I also have the severe fear of vomit! Something interesting is that I kept a notebook throughout my stay there. Every single page documenting my 3 month long stay there. I have every experience, good and bad written down. I think it would be really cool if you wanted to take a look at some of those experiences! I haven't cracked that baby open in a minute. I believe the exposures did help a lot of my anxiety triggers. I am much better socially. However, I do suspect I have an underlying neurodiversity that is yet to be diagnosed (think autism or adhd.) Which kind of fumbles my feelings about this place. If I am on the spectrum, they basically just taught me how to mask through their idea of ""Fake it till you make it!"" (which was literally said to me quite a few times.) Then, seeing the amount of teenagers who go misdiagnosed on the spectrum who have OCD and Anxiety issues is concerning if we are sending them to a place that preaches faking it till you make it. Some of the exposures were fucking ridiculous. I told my therapist about my fear of vomit and she set me up to chug bottles of sparkling water. She would make me sit there, bloated. I will agree that it did help aid in lessening my anxiety around my bodily functions. However, after I did some more work there, she sat me down and told me she does not believe I really had a fear of vomit. She refused to 'diagnose' me with emetophobia, even though my entire life I have struggled with everything vomit. The Psychiatrist said I fit all criteria for PTSD and even called my father to let him know. Then he proceeded to not diagnose me with it (?). He also had my roommate on 2 xanax a day for months I told my therapist of sexual trauma I experienced as a child. She did her legal duty of reporting it to my state and then we never ever talked about it again. I even requested to talk about it with her more. She denied because she just wanted to continue my work on my anxiety. All of the depression treatment was basically just ""it's all in your head."" They would just force you to do shit and call it treatment. If I did not participate in a module they convinced me that I was fucking up and prolonging my treatment. Finally, since my dad was an alcoholic and unsuitable to parent me, they tried to convince him that the best option was to send me to a therapeutic boarding school. I did not ever agree to go to the treatment center in the first place, and now I was being told I could be shipped off to another place. They forced me to fill out 1 application to the boarding school before my dad even considered me coming home. I did end up coming home, luckily. At the end, I felt very accomplished because I believe they gaslighted me into believing I had done something very good for myself. I did not see what was going on. I knew that something was wrong, but I did not connect dots until a little later on. I did feel very good initially. Integrating back into life was weird because they didn't teach me how to use technology properly (screen time n shit). But, I slowly realized all I learned there was how to force myself to do things when I feel shitty. Which still doesn't really work lol I LOVED Don, regardless of the treatment. He was the only person of authority who ever truly listened to me there. I was crushed when he passed away.","All of the depression treatment was basically just ""it's all in your head.""

Most people who eat meat don’t hate animals.

Maybe at some point in the future there will be practical alternatives to phase out meat but the best we can do right now is to educate the public about what happens in the meat/dairy industry, inform them how to make more sustainable choices and support farms that treat their animals more humanely (I understand none are 100% cruelty free but if you’re gonna buy meat anyways might as well support those who are the most animal welfare certified).

c47vtby,AnimalRights,"The person that owns this sale barn was a close and personal friend of mine, in fact, when I was in my late teens and my parents were doing their own psychotic thing - his mother for the most part raised me. The way auctions work is that someone drops animals off to be sold. Regardless of condition, the sale barn accepts them. The sale barn is not authorized to do anything to the animals, because they don't belong to the sale barn. Up until the animal is sold, they belong to the person who brings them in, and after the auction, they belong to the buyer. And from a legal standpoint, if he were to have a horse euthed, it wouldn't be a whole lot different than a stranger going into your back yard and having your horse killed. He just wouldn't have legal grounds to put a horse down that didn't belong to him. But there is something a little more distressing at work on this case. In NM, they have brand laws, and before any livestock animal (horses and cattle for darned sure) can be moved, a brand inspector goes out and writes up what is called a ""hauling permit"". They go out, and write up all of the marks on the animal, much like a coggins paper, and check the coggins before the animal can be moved. The brand inspector for the point of origin is who would have seen these animals in their emaciated state, and should have launched an investigation. More than that, if a horse is moved without a hauling permit, then the brand inspector is supposed to seize the animal, and hold it while a hearing occurs to determine ownership of the horse/cow. But Dennis is a good person, he has high integrity and a good heart. I watched one time when someone brought in a gelding that had gotten caught up in a cattle guard, and the horse had rubbed all hide off of both hind legs (down to the bone), basically from the hock to the fetlock joint, and the horse was in so much pain that he couldn't even stand when he wasn't moving. Instead of waiting for the horse to sell in the auction, he bought the horse from the owner on the spot, and as soon as the sale was completed, he had him euthed. He wasn't willing to let the horse sit in one of the pens until sale day came along, suffering while the owner tried to harvest a few bucks off of a horse that they had destroyed. Also, he has pens of horses that he himself will buy, to sell when he has the big auctions. In each pen with 20 horses, he'll have about 4-5 of the big alfalfa bales, the 4x4x8s, so that the horses don't have to fight with each other to get to food. But I have never seen any of his own horses thin. More than that, I can't count the number of times I have seen him take starving horses and feed them back up to a decent weight. Edit - also the video didn't show abuse to dozen of horses, it showed 3 horses that had been starved out and were dying. Horses don't stay at the sale barn over a week - they come in, are sold the first Saturday after they come in, and are out within 48 hours.","Regardless of condition, the sale barn accepts them.

c3e6n4d,AnimalRights,"Last post, and I'll retire into my meat eating ditch for another two years. This is a huge issue with many variables involved, and I don't think either of us want to get into every aspect of animal cruelty/ PETA's role in preventing it. I think we know that there are people who are cruel to animals, just like we know there are members in PETA who are hypocrites or associate themselves with ALF. I think it's fair to say most meat eaters don't want to see animals ""suffer,"" like in those linked youtube videos just like most members in PETA don't want to cause legitimate violence to people and property as a result of their beliefs. I don't think it helps get a point across to talk in extremes, because they aren't relatable to the majority of people. I want to address a few points and point out some myself since our conversation went a bit wayward, which I am partly to blame for. I understand PETA's need for shock value, which is why the picture in that article of the guy in leather being spanked by the dominatrix was funny. My point was that shock value only works FOR a cause if it's handled appropriately. Comparing something that is in no way comparable to the Holocaust is farcical at best, and dangerous at worst. Humans and most other animals are different. I understand that we're animals, but we're sentient, self-aware creatures who have a full understanding of what's going on. A chicken doesn't. It's documented in the mirror test numerous times that only a handful of mammals are self aware enough to recognize themselves in a mirror, which does create an important distinction. You may not agree that it's a good enough gauge, but like it or not, humans aren't chickens, and while they may feel pain and react to stimuli, ""suffering"" is a more abstract concept that a chicken cannot comprehend, so when you compare the slaughter of cows for food to genocide, you're setting yourself up for criticism, and most of it will be legitimate. Incidentally, comparing things to the Holocaust/ Hitler/ Nazis is like throwing a grenade into a discussion. The absurdity will make you lose. Godwin's Law. Not mine. That quote was an example of one person's decision to go vegan. So what? I appreciate the sentiment behind it, and what they went through was a horrible and preventable tragedy, but let's not read into it more than that. People go vegan for different reasons. Vegans start eating meat for different reasons. So what? ""Just for future debates you may have on this topic, a good way to get someone to stop taking you seriously is when you reference the animal kingdom for what a human does"" And a good way to get someone to stop taking you seriously is when you compare killing animals to the Holocaust. Fair point you've made, nonetheless. It's always funny how someone who takes that ""well if other animals eat animals, then humans can eat animals too"" to the ""Well then we should be allowed to rape and kill each other"" extreme. It's an example of taking one idea and applying it to every idea that may fall within that very broad spectrum. The reality is that it is a pretty silly comparison. As a society, we couldn't function by murdering and raping each other. We function perfectly well, thrive, evolve, and succeed as a result of eating meat. The only downside is that animals that otherwise would be eaten by other animals, are now eaten by humans. I believe we as humans have an obligation to protect our interests as well as things that are ""lower"" than us from legitimate cruelty, which is why PETA has been involved in making some very important changes, but if you were to ask me or many other people who think critically if comparing the killing of animals to the Holocaust, Jeffrey Dahmer, or any other tragedy is a good way to get a message across? I'd say that it's ridiculous and ultimately will have more people second guessing your value system than supporting it.","I think we know that there are people who are cruel to animals, just like we know there are members in PETA who are hypocrites or associate themselves with ALF. I think it's fair to say most meat eaters don't want to see animals ""suffer,"" like in those linked youtube videos just like most members in PETA don't want to cause legitimate violence to people and property as a result of their beliefs.

The only people now willing to do this are conservationists and a certain amount of volunteers. This is just to do the trapping. So in order for all of these wildlife conservation officers to do this... in addition to their already extremely taxing job (and yes ... it is) you are going to have to pay much more overtime, and hire new (and less qualified) employees. If externalize this effort... to say private contractors.... the government is still paying for it... unless PETA is willing to fund the operation of course... anyways. So there is the overhead for the extra personnel to set, check and harvest these (live traps). Then you have the cost of traps themselves. One trap (for the size of these pigs) would cost you anywhere from 50-100 dollars. There are a lot of pigs... a lot... and that is a lot of traps. Then once we have all this trapping business sorted out... we have to think of the next step... neutering. You are going to have to pay veternarians since I'm guessing the unethical treatment of a pig farmer with a burdizzo in hand to cut the little guys baby maker's off. Ok, so that's some cash right there, unless it's probono work... which we still end up paying for in ... taxes. Include the manhours of people having to transport the pigs to and from a neuter site and work that location. You've got a seriously huge fiscal burden on the populace.

hc0vaqj,HerpesCureResearch,"Yes, I'm not sure if they've disclosed their latest from the ongoing preclinical data, but here's what they've put out on the public record so far: [ **What results have you seen that support the clinical development of ΔgD-2?** Extensive molecular and preclinical work has been completed for ΔgD-2, which induces unprecedented sterilizing immunity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2 challenge in multiple pre-clinical models. Not only did the vaccine prevent disease, but ΔgD-2 also prevented the virus from establishing latency, which no herpes vaccine has shown before. Latency refers to the ability of the herpes virus to remain dormant particularly in nerve tissue, often establishing lifelong infection with frequent subclinical or clinical reactivation. ΔgD-2 acts via a novel mechanism of action that is mediated by non-neutralizing, Fc receptor activating antibodies to prevent both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection with a wide range of clinical and laboratory isolates. The broad protection observed in a variety of pre-clinical models combined with the potential for sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by absence of latent virus, support the clinical development of ΔgD-2. **Why may ΔgD-2 work as both a preventative and a therapeutic vaccine?** Pending results from clinical trials, the same antibodies that activate cellular killing to prevent infection with herpes virus may also treat someone with recurrent disease. Following vaccination with ΔgD-2, the antibodies would rapidly clear the reactivated virus, thus preventing or ameliorating recurrent disease or transmission to others.","Latency refers to the ability of the herpes virus to remain dormant particularly in nerve tissue, often establishing lifelong infection with frequent subclinical or clinical reactivation.

j604csg,FeMRADebates,"patriarchy is as system created and supported men by for the oppression of women? A system. Racist oppression of blacks is not and never was a conspiracy of whites against blacks either, it was a system, held by beliefs many had.  Men could also beat and rape thier children and get away with it for the most part, but that was not the norm. I don't get this point. I said women had zero protection from their husbands, they could get raped and it was legal, so how were women ""protected"" in any way?  Do you also believe that parents controling the finances and not let children spend money as they wish is about ""oppression and nothing else""? This is very interesting answer, you think treating women like children is not about oppressing women? It's very clear: Children are children, adults are adults, and treating adults like children is massive oppression. Very, very easy to see. Apart from the fact that (1) no one used the children analogy ever, people who justified the oppression of women just openly said ""women are less worth than men"" and (2) women were not treated like children, if a child was raped people didn't ask the child ""What were you wearing?""  Until very recently in history the vast majority of work that humans did was on a farm. What does that change? There were massive restrictions on women in the workforce, that's a fact. Do you want to deny this?  Personally I would argue that the west no longer lives under any sort of ""patriarchal system"". I said that women did not lose anything in the past through the abolition of patriarchy (except their oppression if you will).  It might be your opinion that there is no possible way women lives would be worse if they were treated the same as men Women's lives would be substantially better.  Do you see many feminists fighting that consent to sex is consent to parenthood like the standard is for men... or do you see the opposite? I see no feminists saying men shouldn't have the right to abortion (women and men should have it) and I see no feminists arguing that women should have the right to not pay child support (both women and men should be forced to pay). No double standard whatsoever, and definitely not ""treating women like children.""  Do you see them arguing that men are unable to consent to sex after drinking alcohol like they do for women? Everyone who is incapacitated (doesn't mean a little alcohol, it's about being unconscious) is unable to consent and feminists agree on that.  Do you see them fighting for equal sentencing for equal crimes? There are no laws saying that there have to be different sentences. If there is a bias, that's nothing that can be changed with laws, and especially it's nothing that is more urgent than a complete overhaul of the criminal justice system. For example, instead of fighting for equal sentences for possessing marijuana, it should be legalized. But more importantly: What has this to do with ""treating women like children""? Whites receive lower sentences, do you want to say that ""whites are treated like children""?","Men could also beat and rape thier children and get away with it for the most part, but that was not the norm.

drwpiv2,FeMRADebates,"Yes, anyone of any sex can develop an ethnicity-related fetish. But is it disproportionate in white women? I am not sure. It might be more prominent in white women due to European cultures generally being more open to cosmopolitanism, more individualistic and less racist and thus less opposed to race mixing. But there is a biological reason for ethnicity-difference-fetishes. Basically, if person A and person B are both from different ethnic backgrounds, and they have sex and they reproduce, the resultant offspring will have immune systems with a wider spectrum of resistances. Indeed, the theory is that the *Westermarck Effect* not only prevents incest but encourages genetic-diversity-fostering breeding practices. So is a different-ethnicity-fetish a bad thing? Its arguably a *eugenic* practice so I'm tempted to suggest no. But do white women fetishize non-white men other than black men? Well from what I see the two big US ""race fetishes"" are... well... I hate to put it this way (and as a non-American who doesn't specialize or know that much about race issues I request some charitable reading here), its always of the... ""historically problematized"" minorities. Part of it may be ""dating the bad boy to annoy Daddy"" complex, but the big race fetishes I see in the US are for persons of African and Central-Southern American descent... or if we're talking porn stereotypes, the BBC and the Latin Lover. It may also be partially due to these two ethnicities being seen as more masculine and... more Stanley-Kowalski-macho... than whites. Which would also explain why Indians and Asians... whom are generally well-integrated and also perceived as lacking in machoness... are less fetishized. As for middle eastern persons this is a *very* hard issue. Jews? Well Ashkenazi Jews are generally in a similar boat to Asians/Indians, are seen as tame/relatively establishment, Mizrahi Jews/Israeli Jews may have a better chance. Plus, Israeli Jews are highly genetically diverse. Arabs are in some ways the ultimate ""date this guy to make Daddy angry"" race these days, but Iranians aren't Arabs. Of course, according to ""stupid pop-culture"" they ""might as well be"" and as we all know this is stupid, but people will believe what they want to believe and they think all Islamic populations are ""Arabs"".

e2njjpg,FeMRADebates,"Spanish guy here. The consent law they are proposing has been presented in an incredibly charitable way in the headline. It was not proposed as a ""yes mean yes"" law, but as a ""anything but an explicit, verbal 'yes' *from the woman* makes everything that happens non-consensual"". A closer phrasing to the proposal is also presented in the body or the article:   Proposing the law, Carmen Calvo Poyato, Spain’s deputy prime minister and equality minister, said: **“If a woman does not expressly say yes, then everything else is no.”** Regarding the case about *la manada*, the article says:   Two of the men filmed the assault, during which the woman is silent and passive. The judges interpreted this as consent – one judge even commented that she appeared to be enjoying herself – and the charge was dropped from rape to the lesser crime of sexual assault. I guess they are going by the most popular narrative, and not by what can be seen in the videos. As an example, the police reporting on the actions filmed say things of the sort ""she's falling forwards and taking hold of the penis of one of them"" when it seems quite obvious that she's masturbating him *and sucking his penis*, or ""they are forcibly siting on her face"", when she's pulling him towards here with her hand... I mean, those guys are despicable, and they deserve punishment (for a number of things such as stealing her phone, filming the sex without her permission and, in theory, wanting to share the videos in the internet), but there is a reason why it was basically impossible to call this ""rape"" even with everything having been filmed, according to the Spanish Law, precisely because of *what* was filmed...   Under Spanish law, rape must involve violence and intimidation. If she had been, e.g., incapacitated, unconscious, or too drunk or drugged to ""be responsible for her own decisions""... It would have been rape, too. ""Violence and intimidation"" refers to a wider range of actions than it would appear if used colloquially. They were all (including her) drunk and at least some of them druggeg, but apparently not enough to not be able to consent, btw So, of course, the only way something like this would have been considered ""rape"" from the legal point of view would be by demanind that, unless she provides explicit, *verbal* consent (which she didn't, at least in the videos), the Law recognizes such situation (the lack of explicit, *verbal* consent *from her*) as ""rape"". Changing that now won't change the outcome of this case specifically, but... I have two main objections to the proposed law as formulated: 1. It is heavily gendered. Notice that it is the woman who gives consent of denies it. The man is not required to give consent to a sexual encounter (meaning, a man's consent is assumed, or not required) and therefore, by this proposed law, men are not equally protected in cases when it is a woman who makes any sort of unwanted (by the man) advance towards him. 2. It shifts the burden of proof onto the ~~person~~ man being accused. He (it must be a ""he"" given the gendered nature of the proposed law) is guilty of rape/sexual assault/misconduct unless *he* can demonstrate that *he* got ""explicit, verbal consent from *her*"" for every action *she* may accuse him of commiting (towards *her*) without *her* consent.","It would have been rape, too.

What I would like is for people like you to acknowledge that gender itself is fucked and both femininity and masculinity are fucked concepts used for the oppression of women. And to a lesser extent men too. I’m 100% with you on this. I do not feel gendered and to be honest I don’t understand gender or how anyone can “feel” a gender and have only complied with it in my life because it was easier than voicing dissent and I don’t care enough about the issue personally to argue about it for my own sake. I think gendered traits are ridiculous and only reinforce sexism (against both sexes). But I didn’t think that argument would go over well in this community where I can hardly even just voice an opinion as a feminist without being down voted (despite it being against community rules to down vote) or reported. I don’t personally believe that these traits are unique to masculinity, but they are typically and traditionally associated with it when placed on a masculine/feminine spectrum: strength, courage, independence, confidence, assertiveness, logical, spatial, protective, competitive. It’s good to be assertive, but not to the point that people are put off by it. It’s good to be independent, but isolating in excess. It’s good to be courageous, but not to the point where the risk irrationally outweighs the reward. It’s good to be protective, but not to the point where you imprison. It’s good to be confident, but not good to be arrogant. Toxic masculinity is the stuff that crosses the line. It hurts other people in its excess; the expectations of these traits from those who identify as masculine hurts them too (either through shame of not meeting the expectations or the consequences of what happens when people overcompensate for their insecurities). I guess I feel like if I can’t convince people to abandon gender, then at least maybe I can convince people to move away from the extremes. Anything in the extreme has the potential to be harmful. But since men feel like they must be masculine, and are in fact expected to be masculine by mainstream society, and masculine traits are generally power-oriented, they can do significant harm in those extremes.

d8z38cg,FeMRADebates,"This article discussed ways that Chinese women are specifically disadvantaged compared to men. Could you agree to an argument that this might need more specificity as its referring to the ways in which women are disadvantaged differently compared to men? As in, these are the specific ways in which women are disadvantaged, whereas men are disadvantaged within this system, but in different ways.  Chinese women have it hard. Again, we agree on this point, and I am not disagreeing with the article on this point. I am, however, disagreeing that having it hard is unique to the women of China, within the context of what is discussed in the article.  Those are gendered issues the article is talking about. Sure, and again we do agree on this point. My disagreement is that while the specific problems mentioned are gendered, the cause of the problems, the economic situation that the women, and their partners, are in is not gendered. I'm saying that what the article is ultimately talking about is the female symptoms of the problem, and then frames it in a way as though it only affects women - which is true in the context of those specific problems, but the overarching issue is not something that only affects women, and the cause of women having these problems isn't specific to being female.  I don't think it implies that men are just bumming around doing nothing at all. OK, but the entire article talks about all this hard work women are doing juggling two jobs. Obviously reading between the lines means that surely the men in this situation must also be having to deal with problems, like working two jobs, and yet no mention of that is made, because the article is suggesting that the issue of having to work, essentially, two jobs is something unique to women. I'm just saying, the article would be a lot better if it included the men's side of the story, rather than painting a picture of women as the victims of their society, and ignoring men as being in the same position. It ends up insinuating, to me at least, that men aren't doing enough - but makes no mention of what men ARE doing, and if that even IS enough or not.  If this was an article solely about Chinese men, would you still have the same response but this time saying that it should include women as well? To be fair, though, that article most likely wouldn't get made - except maybe on websites that neither of us would like to visit. You would have to have an article talking about how hard men have it, and then insinuating that the women weren't pulling their weight in kind. This hypothetical article would have to talk about how men are working 2 jobs, 16+ hours days, basically no sleep, mental and emotional misery, and then talk about how they come home to expectations of helping out with house chores, etc. It would have to be written in a way that suggests that the woman in the relationship isn't pulling her weight, while talking about all the ways in which men are. And in that article, yes, I absolutely would call it out for the same reason, because the woman isn't at home doing nothing at all. She's very, very likely pulling her weight and doing her part for the family. But, again, this article would almost certainly be coming from a website authored by Milo or Elam, and it would be publicly panned outside of their specific audiences.  I've seen many articles on this sub focusing only on men, and so far I've seen very few people have an issue with ""why doesn't it mention women, women have it bad too"". I agree, and again, I have tried to cut back on my own end. I felt compelled to point out what I saw from this article, however, and in this case it was 'surely the men aren't all just sitting around doing nothing at all, as the article seems to insinuate'.  Or at least it would be possible if people were equally engaged in discussions about both sexes, but that doesn't seem to be the case on this sub. And you're absolutely right, that its not. I've tried to include articles, when I find them, and when I can, that focus on women. Still, in this sub's defense, this lack of content regarding women is likely, at least in some small part, because of how common it is to find articles talking about women exclusively, and framing problems that aren't specific to women, or have a comparative for men, in exclusively female terms. So, I agree with on that, at least, that I'd like to see more posts regarding women - I just wish it didn't mean that we have to ignore men's very similar plight, like with this article, to do it, or throw men under the proverbial bus in some cases.","Those are gendered issues the article is talking about.

cz3yeq3,FeMRADebates,"I'll preface this by saying that this comment is in no way trying to justify or excuse false rape accusations, but rather explain why they sometimes may occur.  On a side note, I think it's pretty funny that a large chunk of intentionally false accusations could be solved by getting rid of slutshaming. I 100% agree. I made [this]( comment before where I said: ""That being said, I understand the pushback in framing an issue that negatively affects men/women by talking about how a different issue that negatively affects women/men can contribute to it. I understand it because it’s how I feel when for example, I see people suggesting that part of women being passed over for promotions at work is due to the fact that men don’t have government mandated parental leave. My knee-jerk reaction is “Why are you framing a women’s issue as a men’s issue?!” But, I realize that part of gender equality is considering all the factors that contribute to issues and discussing all of them – in this case, while men not having government mandated parental leave isn’t the entire cause of the effect of women being passed over for promotions at work, it is a factor. If we can’t talk about this and realize that these issues affect everyone once we look at what’s causing them, we aren’t going to fix it. Some people, and to be perfectly honest, gender justice advocates can be the worst of them, want to claim an issue as a men’s issue or as a women’s issue and refuse to see that these issues are oftentimes the result of multiple more abstract issues affecting both men and women that are simply manifesting in a way that hurts one gender more at the apex."" And I made [this]( post where I said: ""If we want to address this confusion that some men may face and the consequences that both may face, we should look at why some women sometimes say no when they mean yes. We believe that there are issues involving slut-shaming and fearing for the consequences if one says “yes” that should not be hand-waved away if this issue is to be addressed. Some women may fear being called a slut, a whore, desperate, etc should they agree to engage in (or even initiate) sexual activities. If we want women to say what they mean (and I think we all agree that we do), we need to remove the consequences for it the same way those consequence have largely been removed for men. By failing to do so, we perpetuate a society where we encourage women to engage in dishonest communication, enforce gender norms of passive women and active men, and this may subsequently increase the incidence of rape."" False rape accusations are an issue where I see some MRAs talking about a few of the reasons why they may occur (typically framing women in an understandably negative way such as a woman trying to get back at or punish a man, publicity, etc), but they don't tend to consider reasons that may show an issue that women face (and as I said in the first linked comment, I understand the reluctance to do so, but we are doing ourselves a disservice if we don't). I think they're missing a big chunk of the picture, which includes that some women may make a false accusation to self-preserve, and that slut-shaming is a *really* big part of that. I would need to verify again as it's been awhile since I last checked, but my understanding is that false rape accusations are made disproportionately from white women against minority (usually black) men. Based on my experiences and my friend's experiences, I know that some people think that white women dating anyone other than a white man is somehow devaluing themselves. I can see young women who live in less than progressive areas internalizing that message, personally not caring that much about it, being in a relationship with someone besides a white man, sleeping with them, and then realizing that they are going to face some really harsh social backlash for doing so. I specify young women because I can vouch for the crushing pressure that comes from trying to avoid any sort of slut-shaming which seems to be stronger the younger you are. All that to say that yes, some women will make malicious false accusations for the purpose of hurting a man, but I think an even larger group of women make a false accusation for the purpose of saving face. If we remove the need to save face for, you know, something that shouldn't be treated as shameful for everyone, but particularly for young women, I strongly suspect the number of false rape accusations would go down. I think if we don't acknowledge the way a female issue may be contributing to the problem, we simply aren't going to make a lot of progress or make one of the manifestations of that issue ever fully go away.

darxml7,FeMRADebates,"My point is not to conflate scientific and humanities jargon, I recognize that the uses of the two are meaningfully distinct. My point is to separate a framework for jargon which I regard as useful from one which I think is an impediment to good work.  What claims of Foucault's do you find to be historically inaccurate, and why? I don't think that it's at all correct that discipline, as we commonly understand it, in these institutions in 18-19th centuries in Western Europe, would all be accurately described as the imposition of docility and utility on bodies, except in tautological terms if we reject anything which doesn't fall under these terms as an example of ""discipline."" Then as now, discipline needed, and often contained, a strong psychological focus to instill a lasting change in the mentality of its subjects.  In a scholarly context I think that it's entirely reasonable to expect other professional scholars to notice when a work explicitly defines how it's rethinking a concept or a term. In the humanities it's not just that such definitions don't detract from clear communication; it's that they're literally required for it given the subject matter of many scholars. When Benjamin wants to rethink time or Heidegger wants to rethink being, they necessarily have to depart from common ways of speaking because the point of what they're doing is to create an alternative way of thinking. That's a completely different goal than what sciences are trying to accomplish, and it consequently requires a different set of methods and a different approach to writing. I disagree that redefining commonly used words is necessary or even helpful for the goal of creating and communicating an alternate mode of thinking. Indeed, I've generated major shifts in my own mode of thinking on a number of occasions throughout my life, and the only times when this involved redefining basic terms with which I communicated my ideas, those redefinitions themselves were grounded in essential confusions. The philosophers who've had the greatest lasting impact on my manner of thinking have all been ones who were able to convey novel ideas in entirely conventional language. I'm not familiar with Benjamin's work, but Heidegger was tremendously influential despite having, and in my opinion deserving, in modern times a reputation for not only being tremendously confusing and obtuse, but confused and unsound in content. And his extensive use of jargon (and I know I have a lot of company among academics in believing this) did a lot to obscure the fundamental confusions of his content. Rather than being necessary to convey an alternate mode of thinking, his jargon was necessary to obscure its fundamental failings. Or, perhaps, Heidegger was much more correct than I give him credit for, and was also accurate in his assessment that nobody actually understood him, which doesn't seem to speak highly of his use of jargon either.","My point is to separate a framework for jargon which I regard as useful from one which I think is an impediment to good work.

d7ufl8u,FeMRADebates,"Yes you did. That was a quote from your post upthread. Yeah fair enough I scrolled up and found it. I feel like the conversation has moved on from 'how did men get the vote' to 'why was the franchise extended'. Happy to clarify. *Having* the vote was not tied to the duty to fight and is demonstrated by the fact that men who did not, could not and would not in future be able to fight still had the vote. Even for those 19=year-olds who were (theoretically) enfranchised early, it was because they *had fought*, not because they were potentially subject to conscription. *Getting* the vote, the extension of the franchise, was linked in part to the fact that men had served in the war without being able to vote, but it was far from the only factor.   Well, the 'too young' would be excluded anyway, You know, when someone lists four things and you only respond to one of them, it looks like you're doing it because you don't have an answer for the other three. Yeah, the voting and conscription ages means that in 1918 you can't be too young to be conscripted but old enough to vote. Would you address the other exemptions?   The point is that there was a lot of discrimination and unfairness going on If your point is 'well men were still being discriminated against too'. This is accurate, of course. My understanding is that Straughan's point is that women should not have expected the vote when they were not being drafted.

Rape victims know better than anybody how much of an ongoing danger their own rapist is to society. They understand that getting them investigated is likely to inhibit their behaviour even though they are unlikely to be prosecuted. They don't always realise there may already be a complaint on file or that the record of their own investigation may help if they are investigated again later. This will be pointed out to them by friends and family though, often repeatedly. Rape counsellors understand all this too, and will explain it to victims. There is room for more reporting but it has to be by making the process more attractive. Pushing victims harder will just push more victims away from support services. One reason young victims often do not want their parents to know is because they fear they will be pushed to report, and perhaps disbelieved or shamed if they do not. Rape denialists and misogynists love talking about reporting. It bothers them that surveys using a very inclusive definition of rape show a high prevalence of rape, justifying more funds for the Feminist Rape Industry. So they like to push reporting as the true measure (after allowing for false reports of course) The logic is that if rape is not reported then it did not happen and can not be counted.","There is room for more reporting but it has to be by making the process more attractive.

i0jrly8,Intactivism,"Taken from 4chan: I've never sucked a dick, but the answer is just do it. You have to stop thinking of the foreskin as something that is in the way of getting at the head, and start thinking of it as another sensitive part of the penis.

Ultimately though other the ridged band while the skin is forward, the highest stimulation is going to be via the frenulum and glans when retracted. I'm assuming you're either female or circumcised, imagine this. The ridged band is where the inner and outer foreskin meet, so the tip. It's extremely sensitive. When the skin is pulled back it sits at the end of the frenulum and inner skin, midway down the shaft. So as you suck, or he penetrates, or whatever, if the skin is kept back the whole time there's this kind cascade like feeling, the glans feels good, then the frenulum feels better and better with it as you go down, the inner foreskin stretch receptors add sensation,then you reach the peak as you pass over the ridged band and it feels like a whole ring of pleasure around the whole circumference of your penis. Trying to have your tongue go all the way around the glans and ridged band, passing over the frenulum with each revolution, also makes a nice rolling pulse-like pleasure.If you do all this with the skin forward first, it just adds the sensation of retraction, ie the ridged band being stretching and pulling down over the glans and so on, which can feel nice.

gjm5t7t,Intactivism,"**The functions of the foreskin and the adverse effects of circumcision** [The foreskin has several functions and accounts for most of the sensitivity of the penis.]( [A comparison of the sensitivity of an uncircumcised penis and a circumcised one.]( The normal glans is an internalized structure, only exposed briefly during urination, washing, and sexual arousal. Its surface is moist and is not keratinised. However, circumcision converts the glans into an exposed organ. Immediately after the operation, it retains its exquisite sensitivity, and contact with clothing causes considerable discomfort, but it soon becomes desensitised, probably as a result of the laying down of a layer of keratin on the epithelium. A few circumcised men report persistent discomfort from contact with clothing throughout their lives. The epithelium takes on the character of skin instead of a mucous membrane. Not only is the appearance of the glans altered, but also there is a dramatic loss of sensitivity. [A keratinised circumcised penis and an uncircumcised penis.]( No data is collected on the complications and risks of circumcision in America as there is no legal obligation to do so. Infections, hemorrhages, meatal strictures, (partial) amputations of the penis, and deaths occur. Even circumcisions performed in sterile environments result in a lot of complications. Over 100 babies die in the US every year because of complications during the procedure. When circumcision is performed in other, less developed countries, the risks are even higher. [Pictures of complications in adults]( [Pictures of complications in infants]( [Pictures of complications in tribal men]( [Many cut men suffer from meatal stenosis]( * [Fine‐touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis]( CONCLUSIONS: The glans of the circumcised penis is less sensitive to fine touch than the glans of the uncircumcised penis. The transitional region from the external to the internal prepuce is the most sensitive region of the uncircumcised penis and more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis. Circumcision ablates the most sensitive parts of the penis. * [Male circumcision decreases penile sensitivity as measured in a large cohort]( CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality. * [The effect of male circumcision on sexuality]( CONCLUSIONS: There was a decrease in masturbatory pleasure and sexual enjoyment after circumcision, indicating that adult circumcision adversely affects sexual function in many men, possibly because of complications of the surgery and a loss of nerve endings. * [Clinical elicitation of the penilo‐cavernosus reflex in circumcised men]( CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the lower clinical and similar neurophysiological elicitability of the penilo‐cavernosus reflex in circumcised men and in men with foreskin retraction. Circumcised men lack the reflexiogenic nerves of the ridged band and frenulum which trigger this action. * [The prepuce: specialised mucosa of the penis and its loss to circumcision]( CONCLUSIONS: The amount of tissue loss estimated in the present study is more than most parents envisage from pre‐operative counselling. Circumcision also ablates junctional mucosa that appears to be an important component of the overall sensory mechanism of the human penis. * [Erectile function evaluation after adult circumcision]( CONCLUSIONS: Adult circumcision has certain effect on erectile function, to which more importance should be attached. * [Male circumcision and sexual function in men and women: a survey-based, cross-sectional study in Denmark]( CONCLUSIONS: Circumcision was associated with frequent orgasm difficulties in Danish men and with a range of frequent sexual difficulties in women, notably orgasm difficulties, dyspareunia and a sense of incomplete sexual needs fulfilment. Thorough examination of these matters in areas where male circumcision is more common is warranted. * [Variability in penile appearance and penile findings: a prospective study]( CONCLUSIONS: There are significant variations of appearance in circumcised boys; clinical findings are much more common in these boys than previously reported in retrospective studies. The circumcised penis requires more care than the intact penis during the first 3 years of life. Parents should be instructed to retract and clean any skin covering the glans in circumcised boys, to prevent adhesions forming and debris from accumulating. Penile inflammation (balanitis) may be more common in circumcised boys; preputial stenosis (phimosis) affects circumcised and intact boys with equal frequency. The revision of circumcision for purely cosmetic reasons should be discouraged on both medical and ethical grounds. * [Cultural background, non-therapeutic circumcision and the risk of meatal stenosis and other urethral stricture disease: Two nationwide register-based cohort studies in Denmark 1977–2013]( CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides population-based epidemiological evidence that circumcision removes the natural protection against meatal stenosis and, possibly, other USDs as well. * [A comparison of condom use perceptions and behaviours between circumcised and intact men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States]( CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate findings supported the conclusion that intact men may use condoms more frequently and that confidence predicts use, suggesting that intervention programmes should focus on building men's confidence to use condoms, especially for circumcised men. * [The psychological impact of circumcision.]( CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that circumcision is overwhelmingly painful and traumatic. Behavioral changes in circumcised infants have been observed 6 months after circumcision. The physical and sexual loss resulting from circumcision is gaining recognition, and some men have strong feelings of dissatisfaction about being circumcised. * [ORIGINAL RESEARCH—EJACULATION DISORDERS: A Multinational Population Survey of Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time]( CONCLUSIONS: The IELT distribution is positively skewed.

That’s valuable experience we don’t want to eliminate. What we want to do is help them mend the broken relations, guide the kids and make sure it never escalates. If you let that experimental behaviour brew in peace, you will create a toxic environment with insecure children where the behaviour can escalate drastically. I’m a teacher (masters in primary and lower secondary, year 1-7), but I’ve also worked 8 years as a kindergarten teacher (ages 8mo-6years). I can tell you that weather a class is “good” or “bad” is mainly up to the teacher and their support system. Where I’m from we don’t separate children with disabilities, rather we bring in extra resources where necessary. I’ve had children in my classes with all kinds of differences, and I’ve never had a bad bullying problem. I’ve had classes where some children started to display some bullying behaviour, but it worked out well with a little support from my colleagues, better communication with the parents and lots of work with the kids. The girl being picked on was just a little clumsy socially by the way, no physical differences. I’ve also had a class with a girl with Down’s syndrome. She had a wheelchair, and the kids would have little meetings where they discussed rules for games etc. so she could participate. It is how adults meet the children in conflict situations that determine the outcome. Conflict between kids is my number one tool to work on their social skills. I also started school in the 90s, so in a time where we hadn’t quite figured out bullying yet. My year was an absolute nightmare, bad bullying going on from 1st to 10th grade. I don’t even think most of the kids knew why, or what made them so disgusted with the kids they bullied. The year above us though, they had the best environment ever. They were so wholesome and cool, and I believe it’s because the staff worked so goal oriented against bullying from the second the kids started school. One of the girls had dwarfism. I remember my whole year being called in to the auditorium the first week of school. Told us all about Christinas condition and how making fun of her would not be tolerated. A boy from my class got verbally ripped to shreds in year 8 for a comment he made at her.","She had a wheelchair, and the kids would have little meetings where they discussed rules for games etc. so she could participate.

This has triggered aggressive retaliation from powerful groups. Since 7th December 2010 an arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade has been imposed by Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union. **The attack has destroyed 95% of our revenue.** The blockade came into force within ten days of the launch of Cablegate as part of a concerted US-based, political attack that included vitriol by senior right wing politicians, including assassination calls against WikiLeaks staff. The blockade is outside of any accountable, public process. It is without democratic oversight or transparency. The US government itself found that there were no lawful grounds to add WikiLeaks to a US financial blockade. But the blockade of WikiLeaks by politicized US finance companies continues regardless. This was done just by a few government officials calling up corporate executives. During the CISPA debate; there were people who wanted to push clauses that made this a legal standard moving forward.

cc4ifqn,evolutionReddit,"We were recently discussing this while writing some tax software for a local government. Apparently after so many years of delinquency a property can be sold for the amount of taxes and penalties owed. In California it's after 5 consecutive years of default status. An auction is usually held, the winning bidder pays cash and a deed is written up as soon as possible. Once the deed is filed the bidder becomes the rightful owner of the property. Mortgages and other liens are transferred. Or like in this case if the lien is sold, the investors aren't allowed to do anything, not even contact you, during a redemption period. After the redemption period you're screwed. It seems that our local government no longer does this. Or if they do, it's in extreme cases where property has likely been abandoned. Most of the time delinquent taxes have to be settled when the property is sold. This seems to take care of most of the delinquent taxes, while the rest are just written off as a loss. Also there is an exemption for the elderly and disabled. If your property is valued at less than or equal to the exemption then you would owe nothing in property taxes. The investors that do this have to be complete scumbags. And if a city allowed this to be done to the sick and elderly, or even if they still did this at all, people need to pressure their city council to put an end to it. Follow the money and see if the mayor or any councilmen have any connections to these scumbag investment companies. Edit: According the Wikipedia page on tax sales:  In recent years the market in tax liens has been so reliable that a number of banks and hedge funds have invested large amounts of capital in it. Bank of American, Broad Capital, RMPAM, and Fortress Investments are among the big-money participants. It also gives an example of the high interest and fees that one could incur if your tax lien is sold:   NPR reported on a woman losing her home in Baltimore in May, 2010, because she had missed a water payment of $360. Over time her obligation multiplied to over $3,000. ","If your property is valued at less than or equal to the exemption then you would owe nothing in property taxes.

c3td1pm,evolutionReddit,"My greatest fear is that redditors and subs become myopic. I understand to a certain extent there's value in tailoring for everyone's interest; but the reality is that fight is really complex. I'd love a state where people who have knowledge about ""News, Opinion, Analysis,   Discussion of Politics/Government"" are actively contributing knowledge in ""Liberation Tech"" and vice versa. There is problem on reddit with knowledge being either tied up or lost. Until we create some kind of central wiki or database, our knowledge needs to shared until its sort of permanently floating in the majority of redditor's actual brains. Or something like that. In practical terms, I would prefer to push a major network link first, if it becomes to cumbersome that it doesn't build traffic and information flow, then we can retreat back to more customization. Its easier in this direction, than starting with customized and then pushing people to again switch to new habits.

c4yh2qr,evolutionReddit,"lmao, kind of preaching to the choir here, EqMi! hah! well lets put a stop the groupthink cancer then! With Bitcoin, piracy, fuck the government anarchy; its all great for limiting government control on individuals, but people need to remember that the government isn't the only enemy to our liberties. The obvious one is corporations who have a natural preference for low risk rent seeking kind of business models that screw consumers and stop new entrepreneurs. So the optimal play for freedom is actually to get the corporations and government to fight each other and keep each other in check. We're kind of in a bad situation now where they are kind of working together against us. But even aside from those two generalized agents; people often overlook other social forces. Even if we were to create small government and corporations kept in check; there's a real danger that the power vacuum gets taken up by criminal syndicates - usually the mafia or the church or some mix. And so with Bitcoin, it really is a scammers paradise and people need to remember this. Idiots are more likely to get fucked in the wild world of onion blackmarkets and bitcoins. Not sure we can do anything about people generally being gullible. Humans are always the weakest link. _______________________________________ And back to the circle-jerking. Actually the decentralized bit is more important to me than the encrypted anonymous bit. Online freedom is going to get attacked by copyright, cybersecurity and CP bills. Failing all of that; they will just pass new financial regulation rules that legally codify the financial attack against wikileaks. Its incredible that simply at the suggestion of some congressmen, VISA/MasterCard/AMEX/Paypal/Amazon all voluntarily blockaded Wikileaks. Without any kind of judicial order or regulatory requirement to. This is the big weakness of centralized systems, its just so much easier to pile pressure onto the key nodes of control. They can control the entire system by tapping those few nodes. A financial system that can't be pressured like that is very good online freedom. ___________________________ And randomly. I feel too much of the Bitcoin community is filled with speculators; their obsession with thinking of the currency as an investment isn't so different from Wall St traders building a commodities bubble. The value of of BC shouldn't be in its exchange power; it should be about how widely it is being used and accepted. It will be hard to build a truely independent financial system if its only about jacking up the currency. Thats not how normal countries think about their foreign exchange; in fact, many countries actively seek to lower their currency to build their economies. And this highlights basically, theres more interest in speculation than genuinely building a BC economy. What's interesting is, this might prove an opportunity for the latest crop of online freedom activists. Who I think are starting to realize this is a long term game and money is required. During the cold war, it was common for spies to set up shell business; both for naughty things but also as a means to support themselves and their operations. It's more robust if the emerging social network of online activists finds financial independence in a new financial economy, than having to beg for donations every month.

The thing about Anarchism is that everybody has to be on board or it doesn't work, so revolution to reach Anarchism isn't really feasible. It has to be a slow march towards something better because anarchist systems of governing are inherently bad at producing things en masse on an industrial scale or in an industrial fashion. Anarchists have to excel at guerilla warfare, nonlinear warfare, and asymetrical warfare tactics because they don't typically have the means to produce resources to actually directly compete with their opposition.

hnq6aik,IronFrontUSA,"A lot of it comes from late Weimar Germany where the term ""Social Fascist"" was used to describe the Social Democrats because the SPD used the police to put down communist uprisings. Keep in mind several of these ""uprisings"" featured the Nazis and the communists conspicuously working alongside one another to try and overwhelm local governments even though on paper they were supposed to be foes. This is because under Ernst Thalmann, a staunch Stalinist, the KPD believed that the Social Democrats were the biggest opponent to communist revolution, not the Nazis, and that if the Nazis took over then everyone in Germany would ""wake up"" and realize that communism was the answer and not fascism. It wasn't until the Nazis actually took over and communists started getting slaughtered that Ernst Thalmann realized that, surprise, the Nazis weren't his fucking friends.

The argument they make is basically, ""trans people have it *so hard* harder than *anyone*, so stop asking questions and change these laws which aren't even a big deal.""

The same people who talk about rape culture turn around and shame rape victims for not wanting men to walk in on them while they're in a gym shower. Some women can't use these facilities anymore. No boundaries allowed. Keep in mind that a solution that works for everyone is not okay with the trans activists: Having a third, unisex, single-person bathroom is not acceptable, having a special locker room for trans students to change for gym class is not acceptable. They are demanding that women validate their self-perception against their will. As far as feminist analysis, they are redefining words so that things can't be understood. ""Gender"" had nothing to do with personality or your inner self. It was about sex roles, sex stereotypes, so we could differentiate between the material reality (biological sex) and the socially imposed and created (gender), because before the two parts were conflated to make the social reality *seem* like a natural consequence of the material reality. They've basically reversed the meaning of gender, made it out to be a natural, real, essential part of every person's psychology, naturalizing sex stereotypes and sex roles. It's sexist as fuck, it's offensive to women and men both. In trans theory land you have to be a real fucking monster to be a ""cis man."" Whereas feminism was about how women are oppressed because of our sex, trans feminism proposes that feminine people are oppressed because femininity is unfairly unvalued. Hopefully I don't have to explain how stupid that is.  What would you have done about it then? And more generally, about all these issues? That is a real question, I'm curious. People aren't entitled to play in sports. Most people just don't have the bodies to be competitive in sports. You can't even take effective ADHD medication and play in sports that use Olympic rules (which isn't just the Olympics or professional leagues), more than 5% of people have ADHD and it's a serious disorder, and there isn't even evidence that the meds give people with ADHD an advantage in sports. Disqualifying a tiny number of people because they choose to take hormones that either give them an unfair advantage or a makes them uncompetitive in their own sex's league just really isn't something I can give a shit about. I don't think trans-abled people deserve to be in the Paralympics either, or deserve resources set aside for disable people.  Radical = roll of the eyes. Well yes, all politics that are against the norm are marginalized in the same way. The terminology they use is redefined into worse-than-meaninglessness, the most recognizable words get obscured and maligned. Socialists, communists, anarchists, feminists, and other radicals all end up fighting a war for the meaning of words that they cannot win. Even mainstream political terms change and reverse over time. Makes reading old stuff written about politics a bit of a nightmare. There's a political war of language though, which is obvious when you think about it.","It comes from well meaning, empathetic people. I agree that people sound tin-foily, but the trans activists *are* doing this. They might not be doing these things with the intention *only* to violate women's boundaries and make feminist analysis incomprehensible, which is what it sounds like people say sometimes, but it is happening, and compromises that don't violate women's boundaries are not acceptable to them, and feminism that doesn't validate male trans feelings isn't acceptable either.",Problem-Solution,Participation

It kind of also goes without saying but a lot of what Bernie has campaigned on his entire life is very different from the agenda Clinton is likely to push as president. I don't see her wanting him as VP because I feel he would hound her too much about what she should be doing over what she wants to do which makes for a bad fit. They just don't seem like they would be able to work together to push the same policies well. One the other hand, I don't see it as him giving up at all. He does need to maintain some level of influence if he wants to push his own agenda and being as close to the ear of the president as possible is one way to accomplish that. Whether she would be willing to listen to him and incorporate any of his ideas... I'm not confident in that. Though I do think for as much as she likes to blow him off she is smart enough to realize that he has good ideas that are resonating as well as some incredible foresight.

But that's the crux of this argument and all I'm going to bother to responding to. We could do it, it would just be too expensive and we don't want to, so let the people die.  I'm saying you've decided to never find out because you refuse to consider the possibility you have it wrong. Not at all. I just have different goals than you do apparently in a healthcare system. And I never said that single payer was the only option, I said that we need to get to universal healthcare and single payer was proven to work the world over at driving down costs. But hey, if you want to go with a mandatory Medisave account instead of taxes and do strict price fixing on all healthcare services and then provide heavy subsidies to the majority of citizens the way Singapore does, that works too! Since you like their healthcare system so much, little bit from Harvard on it. Their entire healthcare philosophy: “They believe that nobody in their country, even a foreigner, will go without health care,” Haseltine said during a January 15, 2014 talk at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), where he served as a professor from 1976-92. “If they have to put more money into it to help to help the vulnerable population and the very old population, they do it.”   The difference seems to be I'm interested in finding out what that truth is to that effect-and in doing so seeing the impact of other factors to construct a system in accordance with the conditions in the US to be most efficient, whereas you'd rather rush anything that sounds good and feels good without examining it beyond the superficial. I have examined it from many sides. Is it the best system? No idea. Is it better than what we have now? Absolutely. Know how I know? Cause in the system I have now my best friend hasn't seen a doctor in a decade because he can't afford it and with a single payer system that wouldn't happen. Just that simple. Any system in which everyone can get healthcare is better than one in which only some citizens can get really good healthcare if they are rich enough and millions of others can't get any at all.","But that's the crux of this argument and all I'm going to bother to responding to.

d5t47wy,Political_Revolution,"Because the democrat and republican parties are literally written into state statutes. Because there has always been two parties in America. Because when there is a political revolution, it has come in the form of a change within those parties. The parties are not going anywhere. Does it suck? Sure. Is it going to change? Probably not. America is still a terrific country and we've gotten to this point somehow with these two parties in power. As between the two parties, it's clear which is at all progressive. There is a reason Bernie changed from Independent to Democrat (and not Republican) in order to have a Presidential bid. One platform calls for the banning of porn and Muslims and building a wall. The other calls for higher wages, protection of the environment, and banning the death penalty. Much of this is due to Bernie's influence and the influence of his supporters. While it would be wonderful to have plurality voting in this country, or a third party, it simply isn't practical--at least in looking at history. We would do well to think pragmatically, like Bernie, in knowing that the political revolution comes from influencing and taking over the Democratic party.

To Jefferson this Indian ideal of happiness was, “a sense of personal and societal security,” (103). Happiness, rather than property, was chosen as the third inalienable right because of Jefferson’s encounters with the Iroquois whom he deemed to be “happy” and free from the want excessive property accumulation forces on a society. The Iroquois Confederation also influenced Jefferson in his penning of the Bill of Rights. “The guideline that Jefferson drew from the Indian example (and which he earnestly promoted in the First Amendment) allowed freedom until it violated another’s rights,” (113). Personal liberties and autonomy are a strictly indigenous characteristic. Personal rights and the importance of public opinion in governing are two distinctly non-European values embedded in American society today.

What you can do  We are here to protect Thacker Pass, sacred land of regional tribes, which is imminently threatened by an open-pit lithium mine. We stand in solidarity with native people against the destruction of cultural sites. We need you! Take Direct Action We have spent the past two years emailing, calling, and writing decision makers, media, and environmental groups, telling them all about why Thacker Pass is so important, and why we should protect this land. None of these actions has worked, in part because the 1872 U.S. Mining Law privileges mining above other uses of the land, and in part because the Trump Administration, then the Biden Administration and then Congress ensured “critical minerals” development on public lands in the name of national security. These critical minerals include lithium. Will Falk, co-founder of Protect Thacker Pass has been working hard representing the Reno Sparks Indian Colony and the Burns Paiute tribes in the combined lawsuit (with four environmental organizations and rancher Ed Bartell) against Lithium Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The final oral argument hearing is scheduled for January 5, 2023. Even in the best case scenario, which is that Judge Du vacates the permit for Thacker Pass Lithium Mine Project, this does not protect the land because the company can reapply for their permit and in the meantime, use other existing permits they have at Thacker Pass to continue exploring for lithium, and digging other open pit mines. We can’t rely on the courts or government to protect the land; we have to protect it ourselves. That means direct action. If you can participate in direct action at Thacker Pass in 2023, reach out to us via our Contact Us page. Pressure Decision Makers Express your opposition to this project and demand the permits be rejected and rolled back.

Write as many letters as you can before January 5, 2022 Sample letter to the editor of Elko Daily, by Alex Eisenberg In this letter to the editor, directed to the Governor of Nevada, Alex identifies an article the letter is in response to, and what she is asking the governor to do (divest from lithium mining). She describes exactly what the article gets wrong, asks several pointed questions urging the Governor to consider not supporting lithium mining in Nevada, and outlines why with data she learned from the Protect Thacker Pass website. Sample op-ed to the Sierra Nevada Ally, by Max Wilbert Max submitted this op-ed in response to a letter by the CEO of Lithium Nevada, which made several claims about the benefits of lithium mining and electric cars in reducing greenhouse gas pollution. He first outlines why readers should care about Thacker Pass, and the wildlife and plants who live there, and articulates how he values the land and the Paiute Shoshone people who depend on the land. He then rebuts the CEO’s points with hard data making a clear case for why Thacker Pass Lithium Mine will not help reduce emissions, will destroy critical habitat, and will lead to more pollution, not less. He includes powerful quotes from James Baldwin to help make his point. Sample response to the NDEP permits, by Max Wilbert, published on Protect Thacker Pass Protect Thacker Pass published this response to the permits issued by NDEP on February 25, 2022. These permits permit the pollution of the air, water, and land at Thacker Pass, and allow the Lithium Nevada corporation to escape liability for inflicting these harms. Late 2021 at the public hearings about these permits, we predicted the permits would be issued because an NDEP employee has said that NDEP “never denies permits”. In our response we write about how the regulatory agencies in the United States are designed to permit harm by corporations, rather than to protect the environment. We quote Jane Anne Morris to help make our point about regulatory capture by industry, and back this up with public information about the results of the lobbying Lithium Nevada has done to ensure access to these public lands for mining.

ifjmnju,VeganActivism,"""Are you against animal cruelty?""  #x200B; I've seen this questions in a lot of workshops and I think it is a bad question for a couple of reasons  #x200B; 1 It forces them to pick a side. You crease a 'us' versus 'them' and that makes a open conversation harder 2 Animal cruelty is very vague so they might interpret as something different then we vegans think. \[e.g. abusing pets, hitting cows ect.\] 3 The most common solution proposed to animal cruelty is animal welfare. But what your conversation partner doesn't know is that you are showing them the result of animal welfare. 3b So it is quite easy to end up in a long conversation about animal welfare. Since they are using animal welfare as a defense it is way harder to convince them it is just marketing.  #x200B; tldr; it polarizes, is vague, and makes the conversation harder  #x200B;  ""Animal rights""  #x200B; 1 If they know what it means you create a vegan vs non vegan situation. You want to avoid that because you don't want to argue. You want to affect their subconscious.. 2 If they don't know they won't understand what you are talking about. And if you explain you just talk yourself in a us versus them direction 2b You can explain it to them but a human can only retain a certain amount of information. So choose the information that is most vital for someone to go vegan. 3 The philosophy behind rights is the most famous way of constructing a ethical framework. But in reality people don't use rights that much when deciding what is right or wrong. Virtue ethics, utilitarianism and care ethics are also very common. Saying to a utilitarian that killing animals is bad because it violates their rights is pointless. They don't base their ethics on rights so 'animal rights' has zero convincing power. Typically conversation between people that base their ethics on different systems end up in a 'agree to disagree' conclusion. 4 Technically you don't have to support animal rights as a vegan. Animal rights wants to reform the system of rights to include animals. An alternative is to reject the system of rights. And develop a new system to get justice that includes everyone per definition and cannot exclude. Or not have a system to get justice at all. 4b These people are still vegan because they want total animal liberation. They just don't want to use the tool of animal rights. tldr it polarizes, uses a lot of your information budget, has a very niche usecase One quick tip I have  Try to speak more about the victims as persons and not some abstract far away subject. Turn  how do you feel when you see the suffering and death of animals Into  how do you feel when you see them suffering and dying Also timing is important, try to take what is happening on the screen into account. If you do a lot of outreach you will know what footage is coming. If the victim \[singular female\] just got murdered you say:  how do you feel when you her die?",Typically conversation between people that base their ethics on different systems end up in a 'agree to disagree' conclusion. 4 Technically you don't have to support animal rights as a vegan.

d6scfju,EvolveSustain,"This case reminds me of similar problems that occur in Zimbabwe and its high level of poverty and exclusion, which can be related to climate issues such as **droughts**, but also to macroeconomic issues, like the recent declines in employment, with **youth unemployment** levels rising to close to 70%. I believe an efficient solution for these obstacles is through innovation, which aims at improving the livelihoods of locals. And this can be a tough thing to do, given there are a myriad of factors that undermine the path towards sustainable development. Nonetheless, I see some interesting initiatives that mix innovation with development, such as the collaboration between UNDP and national public authorities from Zimbabwe towards improving the lives of young farmers and, therefore, acting on 2 issues, such as agriculture and young unemployment rate: UNDP interviewed local young farmers, designed 4 entrepreneurship accelerator programmes and rolled them out through a collaborative public-private partnership model along with the Zimbabwe Farmers Union. The outcomes were countless, from a ""Sustainable Produced by Young Farmers in Zimbabwe"" label designed for branding supplies to local supermarkets, to the strengthen of the innovation ecosystem in the country, such as the development of 7 ICT-based agribusiness solutions (to be tested still this year). Finally, overall, I believe solutions for overcoming traditional obstacles for a sustainable development always include finding innovative ways of doing what people is already doing. Oh, and just so I don't forget, I found this example in UNDP's website. Apparently, UNDP has an Innovation Facility, where they create partnerships with civil society, public authorities, private sector, and NGOs, to co-create programmes/projects that bring together innovation and sustainable development. I believe is worth it to take a look in their [latest year in review report]( to see other initiatives like this I mentioned :)","Finally, overall, I believe solutions for overcoming traditional obstacles for a sustainable development always include finding innovative ways of doing what people is already doing.

ikix9kg,climate,"I suspect this article is drivel but I can't get past the paywall. Anyone mind posting the text of the article? Edit: The technology called carbon capture and storage is aptly named. It is supposed to capture carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources and pump them deep underground. It was a big winner in the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress last week. . What the technology, known as C.C.S., also does is allow for the continued production of oil and natural gas at a time when the world should be ending its dependence on fossil fuels. . The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden said he will sign this week, does more to cut fossil fuel use and fight climate change than any previous legislation by expanding renewable energy, electric cars, heat pumps and more. But the law also contains a counterproductive waste of money, backed by the fossil fuel industry, to subsidize C.C.S. . Fifteen years ago, before the cost of renewable energy plummeted, carbon capture seemed like a good idea. We should know: When we launched a start-up 14 years ago — the first privately funded company to make use of the technology in the United States — the idea was that the technology could compete as a way to produce carbon-free electricity by capturing the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by power plants and burying them. But now it’s clear that we were wrong, and that every dollar invested in renewable energy — instead of C.C.S. power — will eliminate far more carbon emissions. . Even so, this technology has broad political support, including from Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, an ally of the coal industry, because it enables the continued extraction and burning of fossil fuels while also preventing the resulting carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Industry campaigns such as “Clean Coal” have also promoted the technology as something that could ramp up quickly to bridge the gap to the deployment of large-scale renewable energy. But by promoting C.C.S., the fossil fuel industry is slowing the transition away from fossil fuels. . Under the Inflation Reduction Act, facilities using this technology will be eligible for generous tax credits provided they break ground by the end of 2032 — an extension of the current deadline of 2025. Those benefits come on top of $12 billion in government investments in C.C.S., as well as technology that would pull carbon dioxide directly from the air, which were included in the infrastructure bill signed by President Biden last fall. C.C.S. is seen as a solution to the emissions problem for a range of industries, from fossil-fuel-fired electricity generating plants to industrial facilities that produce cement, steel, iron, chemicals and fertilizer. . Where C.C.S. has been most widely used in the United States and elsewhere, however, is in the production of oil and natural gas. Here’s how: Natural gas processing facilities separate carbon dioxide from methane to purify the methane for sale. These facilities then sometimes pipe the “captured” carbon dioxide to what are known as enhanced oil recovery projects, where the carbon dioxide is injected into oil fields to extract additional oil that would otherwise be trapped underground. . Of the 12 commercial C.C.S. projects in operation in 2021, more than 90 percent are engaged in enhance oil recovery, using carbon dioxide emitted from natural gas processing facilities or from fertilizer, hydrogen or ethanol plants, according to an industry report. That is why we consider these ventures oil or natural gas projects, or both, masquerading as climate change solutions. The projects are responsible for most of the carbon dioxide now being sequestered underground in the United States. Four projects that do both enhanced oil recovery and natural gas processing account for two-thirds to three-quarters of all estimated carbon sequestered in the United States, with two plants storing the most. But the net effect is hardly climate friendly. This process produces more natural gas and oil, increases carbon dioxide emissions and transfers carbon dioxide that was naturally locked away underground in one place to another one elsewhere. . In an effort to capture and store carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel-burning power plants, the Department of Energy has allocated billions for failed C.C.S. demonstration projects. The bankruptcy of many of these hugely subsidized undertakings makes plain the failure of C.C.S. to reduce emissions economically. The Kemper Power Project in Mississippi spent $7.5 billion on a coal C.C.S. plant before giving up on C.C.S. in 2017 and shifting to a gas-powered plant without C.C.S. The plant was partially demolished in October 2021, less than six weeks before President Biden signed the infrastructure bill with its billions of taxpayer money for C.C.S.: good money thrown after bad. The FutureGen project in Illinois started as a low-emission coal-fired power plant in 2003 with federal funds, but ultimately failed as a result of rising costs. . The Texas Clean Energy and Hydrogen Energy California C.C.S. projects were allocated over half a billion dollars collectively, then dissolved. The list goes on, with at least 15 projects burning billions of dollars of public money without sequestering any meaningful amount of carbon dioxide. Petro Nova, apparently the only recent commercial-scale power project to inject carbon dioxide underground in the United States (for enhanced oil recovery), shut down in 2020 despite hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits. . These projects failed because renewable electricity generation outcompetes C.C.S. Renewable power now is cheaper than coal-fired power without C.C.S. Add the cost of the energy required to couple C.C.S. with fossil fuel power and it becomes hopelessly uncompetitive. We can only guess how much more the full costs of C.C.S. would exceed renewable power because, after decades of promotion and many billions of dollars spent, we still have next to no real-world data about the costs of running, maintaining and monitoring large C.C.S. projects. . These C.C.S. projects are subsidized by Section 45Q of the federal tax code, which now offers companies a tax credit for each metric ton of carbon dioxide injected into the ground. Those enhanced oil recovery subsidies would rise under the new law, from $35 to $60 per ton. The legislation also significantly broadens the number of facilities eligible for tax credits. And those facilities will be able to claim the tax credit through a tax refund. The 45Q program is nominally a program to fight climate change. But since nearly all carbon dioxide injections subsidized by 45Q are for enhanced oil recovery, the 45Q program is actually an oil production subsidy. . The Internal Revenue Service does not provide information about who gets the credits. But we do know that it issued more than $1 billion of these credits as of 2020. . These subsidies create a perverse incentive, because for companies to qualify for the subsidies, carbon dioxide must be produced, then captured and buried. This incentive handicaps technologies that reduce carbon dioxide production in the first place, tilting the playing field against promising innovations that avoid fossil fuels in the steel, fertilizer and cement industries while locking in long-term oil and gas use. . Industry campaigns for C.C.S. also have shifted their decades-long disinformation fight: Instead of spreading doubt about climate science, the industry now spreads false confidence about how we can continue to burn fossil fuels while efficiently cutting emissions. For example, Exxon Mobil advertises that it has “cumulatively captured more carbon dioxide than any other company — 120 million metric tons.” . What Exxon Mobil doesn’t say is that this carbon dioxide was already sequestered underground before it “captured” it while producing natural gas and then injected it back into the ground to produce more oil. These advertising campaigns lend support to government programs to directly subsidize C.C.S. . Solving climate change requires resources; misappropriating these resources makes solving the problem harder. We have no time to waste. We need to stop subsidizing oil extraction and carbon dioxide production in the name of fighting climate change and stop burning billions in taxpayer money on white elephant projects. Clean power from carbon capture and sequestration died with the success of renewable energy; it’s time to bury this technology deep underground.","In an effort to capture and store carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel-burning power plants, the Department of Energy has allocated billions for failed C.C.S. demonstration projects.

k4p7jhl,climate,"From [Globe.com]( By Sabrina Shankman Americans love meat. We eat three times the global average — a whopping 264 pounds per person in 2020. And we keep eating more, despite growing awareness that the raising of livestock for food, particularly beef, is a major contributor to climate change. With rising concern about a sector that worldwide accounts for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and shows no sign of slowing, some scientists, activists, and a few world leaders are talking up a nuclear option: taxes on meat. New Zealand is poised to be the first nation to implement a tax, with a law that would impose levies on farmers who raise beef cattle and sheep starting in late 2025. Denmark’s minister for taxation said last month that he is considering a tax on beef, and European Union policymakers, facing mounting pressure to address emissions from agriculture, are weighing taxes and other price mechanisms in a mix of possible solutions. “If food system emissions are not reigned in, we cannot reach the goal of the 1.5 degrees of the Paris Agreement,” said Franziska Funke a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and coauthor of a study on meat taxes in Europe released earlier this month in the journal Nature Food. That goal — to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times — is necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change, experts say. Funke is among a group of economists and climate scientists who say global trends in meat production are unsustainable, and that taxes may be the most effective way to curb the world’s seemingly voracious appetite. Meats, including beef, pork, and chicken, are “significantly underpriced” compared with the cost of their environmental impact, they concluded in a study last year, most particularly from greenhouse emissions and nutrient pollution. Taking those costs into account would result in meat that is 20 percent to 60 percent higher than market prices, depending on the type of meat, the authors said. At current prices, beef would be $2 to $4 a pound more, they said.","And we keep eating more, despite growing awareness that the raising of livestock for food, particularly beef, is a major contributor to climate change.

We use a whole lot more electricity per capita than we did back then. Coal is degrading our environment. This is true, whether you are liberal, socialist, conservative, anarchist, or chimp. This is only a problem for one reason. Well, two. There are a whole lot of us burning up parts of the planet to run the AC, keep the lights on, keep a shitload of food cold, run street lights, water pumping stations, and computers. And we have a whole bunch of people who are opposed to doing things better, like keeping all those things going while simply changing the power sources we use. So we can have all the things that, as you point out, keep children from dying. But we can no longer do it with coal. Beijing has given itself 6 years to get totally free from coal.

k8qv4zm,ndp,"Genocide is a term that has both sociological and legal meaning. The term genocide was coined in 1944 by a Jewish Polish legal scholar, Raphael Lemkin. For Lemkin, “the term does not necessarily signify mass killings.” He explained: More often [genocide] refers to a coordinated plan aimed at destruction of the essential foundations of the life of national groups so that these groups wither and die like plants that have suffered a blight. The end may be accomplished by the forced disintegration of political and social institutions, of the culture of the people, of their language, their national feelings and their religion. It may be accomplished by wiping out all basis of personal security, liberty, health and dignity. When these means fail the machine gun can always be utilized as a last resort. Genocide is directed against a national group as an entity and the attack on individuals is only secondary to the annihilation of the national group to which they belong. Ironic... Scholars of genocide have distinguished it as a crime different from other forms of war, killing, violence, discrimination, and repression. “Genocidal action aims not just to contain, control, or subordinate a population, but to shatter and break up its social existence. Thus genocide is defined, not by a particular form of violence, but by general and pervasive violence.”8 They note that settler colonial regimes are structurally prone to genocide, and may indulge in “genocidal moments” when they become frustrated by the resistance of a colonized or occupied people I am just glad you don't think it's genocide...","Ironic...

What’s changed is that we’ve weakened our focus on true economic justice at the same time as the right has gone from being irritating but mild mannered Red Tories to full on vile populists.

j7jtyyf,ndp,"for having all this legal knowledge, you seem to be falling behind in remembering what you actually study for law in canada. yes, canadian law students absolutely do go to school for a particular kind of law, but you seem confused about what I meant when I asked that. makes me think maybe you just googled ""kinds of law"" to see what i meant. no, canadian law students dont study specifically tort law or constitutional law or criminal law, etc, but that doesnt mean they dont study something specific. when you apply to a certified law school for an actual law degree, you arent just getting a ""degree in law"", you still have choices to make, like if your degree will be a JD or LLL (or maybe you will study both, which you can do concurrently or consecutively), or you take a dual canadian/american degree, or a JD/MBA.  #x200B; given your lack of knowledge on your own area of expertise, im not sure youre even worth continuing this conversation with, since everything you say now has doubt cast on it for this.  #x200B;   If they cannot make regulations with respect to programs that do not make revenue as they say, then why are they empowered to consider that as a ""factor""? because anything you take into consideration, including the things that would disqualify you from being able to do something, is a ""factor"". thats what the word means. in legal mumbo jumbo (you should know this, self proclaimed expert), a ""factor"" is just ***anything*** that goes into making a decision, regardless if its for or against that decision. in a criminal case, for example, you would weigh mitigating factors and aggravating factors. in this situation, when the CRTC needs to determine whether or not something actually can be affected by the act (which yes, they need to do. things that are explicitly excluded from the act must still be evaluated in order to determine if thats actually accurate), it looks to ***all factors*** that affect the eligibility of a program, including possible revenue generation.  #x200B;   By the way, the Bill does not guide the CRTC in weighing these factors or describe what some of the concepts mean (for example, there is no clear guidance as to the meaning of indirect revenues). funny, last I checked, the government has a well established method of determining what counts as indirect revenues. its called an audit, they do them a lot. dont know if this company is making indirect revenue from something? audit them. the government already does that. it isnt new.  #x200B;   2. Even if the uploader doesn't ""make revenue by uploading"" as you say, it's well known that YouTube runs ads even on non-monetized Youtube channels yes, which is why youtube is affected by the CRTC, because youtube, the company, makes revenues. however, since the youtube users themselves do not make that revenue, they are not affected, and thus, the CRTC cannot impose any regulations or restrictions on what those people say or post. I could not care less if the youtube corporation is told to keep its ads canadian or must pay a tithe to the commissions, since it wont actually stop those creators from saying what they want to say.  #x200B;   Furthermore, do you have a source for your claim that 90% of online content doesn't have ads on it? this is not what I said. 90% of the content on the internet is exempt from things because the users arent generating any revenue. the ads run by social media platforms means that the company itself is regulated, not the users. I dont know about you, but ive never seen so much as a cent from any posts ive made on instagram or twitter or reddit or anything else. ads existing doesnt inherently mean that users are generating revenue, it means that the COMPANY is generating revenue. as for the ""source"", that isnt something you can easily measure, but we can infer and extrapolate from what we do know, like for example, that 0.25% of youtubers generate revenue from their content and posts. im not saying that only 0.25% of all social media is like that, but even if youtube is a twentieth of the standard, then its still below that 10% threshhold. and beyond that, the exact number of 10% isnt the point, the point is that the amount of people affected by that ""revenue"" exception is very low.  #x200B; as for your sources, I'll gladly look to someone OTHER than *Blakes* for why a regulatory bill is good or bad (something about them being a corporate lawfirm that make money from those who would be affect leads me to believe they arent all that impartial or objective). and an opinion article by someone who got their degree from a private catholic school in the Philippines? hardly a great source on the topic. really, youd think after all that time in law school, youd have learned ***something*** about reliable and consistent sources by now.  #x200B;   That's an extremely bad faith/poor reading of what I said. Provide a quote where I made the argument you claim I did. ""Every legal interpretation I've read agrees"". so when I said that using ""well everything ive read"" isnt a valid argument, and you asked for proof, did you just forget that you literally said ""every \[thing\] I've read""? are we having memory issues now?  #x200B; as for any sources agreeing with me, heres one(and no, i dont think ""they agreed with me so im right"" is a valid argument, but you literally asked for it): [I dont like the star as a source, but the contributor here is literally a practicing lawer and the current chief legal and regulatory officer for Bell (someone who would be affected by the act)]( And while not a source, its worth noting that the groups like the CUPE and WGC support the bill.

d8vujjk,MensRights,"I think there's two obvious reasons why men in this scenario didn't interfere as much(ignoring the possibility that there were simply fewer men present at the park). One, the risk of escalation and physical violence is far more real for men than it is for women. Men don't have that protected class status, and couldn't really get away with doing with a lot of those women did in a real situation. You can even notice how oblivious to the threat a lot of these women were, one even mentions it(turning her back to this guy who was, presumably, violent). It's like the threat is not real to them, but for men the threat is always real. Second, I think a lot of men walking by might have waited for an actual physical act before intervening. A man seeing a woman being yelled at or being verbally abused would generally just expect that person to stand up for herself or just leave(if anything, that would be men treating women as equals, rather than helpless victims).

Are you aware of the lives that were saved because of that? The region was about to destabilize. It doesn’t necessarily set a good precident, but what did Iran do about it? Nothing. All that saber rattling around the Persian Gulf for 4 years and they can’t do anything about it because Rouhani got caught red handed. The world avoided a major crisis in the Middle East where ISIS would have re-emerged to face off against Irani backed Shia militias along the eastern Iraqi border. This would have happened ~6 months before the corona virus... that would have spread the virus into a middle eastern war zone. Trumps actions may have saved anywhere between 10,000 and +1,000,000 Iraqi/Irani lives if that played out. **On Russian Sanctions:** we still haven’t pulled back all the sanctions in Russia. In the past few years, we have pulled back in sanctions and added some new sanctions. **On migrants in cages:** we simply want to remove them from the country in the most respectable way possible. All of this is pointless without a wall or some measures to prevent illegal immigration. The wall will force migrants to come in through tunnels, the construction of which can only be financed by groups who can organize/finance 1,000’s of manhours of labor: cartels and human trafficking organizations. Therefore, any migrants who cross will have ties to them and provide leads to quickly shut down tunnels or trace back cartel connections to make real busts. Meth on the border is outrageously common. This helps to actually fight the problem of cartels and THUS =  corruption in Central/South America. Why does fighting corruption matter?

Had they actually been caught eating food without permission, the punishment could range from reduced rations, to torture, solitary confinement, extended sentences for those not already in for life or for repeat offenders, execution.

c08wc2v,humanrights,"first lol. A nurse who secretly filmed for the BBC to reveal the neglect of elderly patients at a hospital has been struck off for misconduct. Margaret Haywood, 58, filmed at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton for a BBC Panorama programme in July 2005. She was struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council on Thursday after being a nurse for more than 20 years. The panel said she ""followed the behest of the filmmakers... rather than her obligations as a nurse"". Ms Haywood, of Liverpool, said: ""I am absolutely devastated and upset by it all. I think I have been treated very harshly. Panorama believes that Margaret Haywood has done the elderly population of this country a great service BBC spokesman ""It is a serious issue and I knew it was a risk I was taking but I thought the filming was justified and it was in the public interest. ""I always made it clear to the BBC that patients would come first at all times."" She said she had voiced her concerns through her immediate line manager ""but nothing was really taken on board"" and the whole process now needed to be reviewed. She was found guilty of misconduct on Wednesday following a fitness to practise hearing. The chair of the panel, Linda Read, said Ms Haywood had prioritised the filming and did not fulfil her obligations as a nurse. ""In the view of the panel, this was a major breach of the code of conduct. ""A patient should be able to trust a nurse with his/her physical condition and psychological wellbeing without that confidential information being disclosed to others. ""Although the conditions on the ward were dreadful, it was not necessary to breach confidentiality to seek to improve them by the method chosen. 'Patients' dignity compromised' She said the misconduct was ""fundamentally incompatible with being a nurse"". ""The registrant embarked upon filming many vulnerable, elderly patients in the last stages of their lives, knowing that it was unlikely that they would be able to give any meaningful consent to that process, in circumstances where their dignity was most compromised. ""The registrant could have attempted to address shortcomings by other means. But this was never a course of action which she fully considered."" Ms Haywood had admitted breaching patient confidentiality but denied her fitness to practise had been impaired. Elizabeth Bloor, the BBC programme's producer, told the hearing there had been ""an over-arching public interest"" to produce the Undercover Nurse documentary because Panorama had received up to 5,000 complaints about conditions. She also said that questions had been asked in the House of Commons about the issues investigated, and the Royal College of Nursing conducted research into patient dignity on hospital wards in the wake of its broadcast. This makes total nonsense of all the talk about openness and transparency in the NHS. Cover-up is the order of the game Joyce Robins, Patient Concern In November the panel found no evidence that Ms Haywood broke the NHS Trust's policy on whistle-blowing by raising concerns about patient care in the documentary, or that she failed to assist colleagues when a patient was having a seizure. A BBC spokesman said: ""There was clearly a strong public interest in revealing that some elderly people were not receiving the level of care we expect from our national health service. 'Right and proper' The decision was criticised by Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern. She said: ""This just demonstrates the priorities of the regulators - rules come before patients every time. The message that goes out to nurses is: however badly you see patients treated, keep your face shut. ""This makes total nonsense of all the talk about openness and transparency in the NHS. Cover-up is the order of the game."" Ms Haywood's actions were also defended by Gary Fitzgerald, chief executive of Action on Elder Abuse. He said: ""We know that we're seeing older people suffering the most appalling care and neglect too often in our care environments. ""In that context I believe what Margaret Haywood did and what Panorama did was right and proper. ""She said the public needs to be aware of what exactly's going on in these places, in these wards, we didn't have any other way of telling them and I think that's the point"".","""The registrant could have attempted to address shortcomings by other means.

j6jwsxw,humanrights,"Even if you ignore the drama and potential academic fraud associated with the studies that show a reduction, the findings are still very small, limited mainly to HIV, and are *in vitro* only. Since circumcision changes the way you have sex, and how it feels, many guys who are circumcised have riskier sexual lives than guys who aren't circumcised. Which is a bit ironic because the idea behind circumcision was to make men have less sexual desire (in the religious context this means sex only for procreation). In Africa there's a real world study showing that circumcision *increases* the spread of HIV even though the virus should technically have a harder time infecting you if you look at just the biology of it. There are other diseases that spread easier in vitro though; the foreskin literally functions to help protect the penis, so when you remove that, some STDs actually have an easier time getting transmitted.","In Africa there's a real world study showing that circumcision *increases* the spread of HIV even though the virus should technically have a harder time infecting you if you look at just the biology of it.

cetvdz4,humanrights,"Vote, inform yourself about different human rights situations. Learn about the history of human rights and what they aim to do, both legally and normatively (in terms of changing perceptions and understanding of individual as well as economic/social rights and states' obligations). Have discussions with people who don't agree with you and try to change minds - even Twitter can be good for creating understanding sometimes. You could join your school's Amnesty International group if it has one or start one if it doesn't. You can travel and make connections to people in other countries - one of the greatest things about human rights is that it creates an international community of like-minded people who you can ally with for mutual solidarity in your different struggles; one of the best ways to stop the persecution of human rights activists is to make their cases internationally known. With human rights work you learn to be pragmatic, but also optimistic; you never expect a state to become a free and democratic place overnight, but very often individual lives are saved, and that makes it all worthwhile. Don't underestimate letter writing, it can be effective, but we are lucky that we now have a lot of other tools available to us to make our views heard online. Choose particular countries or regions that interest you and learn a lot about them - follow the important activists and politicians on Twitter and follow the latest news. If you know enough about a particular human rights situation, you can start blogging about it, and there are a lot of online journalism platforms which are always looking for content to publish if you're willing to do it for free. There are also many small international human rights groups who you could ask to volunteer for. Many groups need their statements proofread in English to make sure they make sense and are intelligible, and you may then be asked to do research work too. It's hard to get paid work in the human rights charity sector, but if you believe in it and can dedicate even a small amount of your time to volunteering, it could be a way to gain experience and eventually employment. I hope my advice is useful.","Don't underestimate letter writing, it can be effective, but we are lucky that we now have a lot of other tools available to us to make our views heard online.

e3hf95l,humanrights,"Again, you're just regurgitating right wing propaganda and it's embarrassing. The Saudis are spearheading genocide against Yemen. The US is giving them the DECISIVE support they need to carry out their genocide -- flooding them with literally 400 BILLION dollars in weapons, giving them intelligence support and LITERALLY refueling their planes as they come back from bombing sorties, murdering children, destroying hospitals, etc. It's apocalyptic, and it 100% would not be happening if the US told the Saudis to lay off -- they're a vassal state and depend on us entirely. The US would stand a chance of telling the Saudis to stop the genocide if our country wasn't full of fake intellectual apologists for genocide such as yourself. This is an extremely black and white issue. Genocide vs. non-genocide. Your creepy ""well if it isn't us it'd be someone else making that blood money"" mentality is simply monstrous. Instead of sitting back and saying ""God it's great to be American, what a prosperous and just land"", how about saying ""why are we supporting genocide and what can I do about it?"" Now, I obviously take issue with the gov'ts of Iran and Saudi Arabia - they're both psychotic. But I'm not going to spend my time raising awareness of that obvious fact, because I'm an American -- therefore, the only place I can really have much of an influence is in America. Lucky for me, our state is behind the majority of the violence around the world, so there's a lot that can be done. The absolute WORST thing to do is to pretend that the US State is the good guy and everyone else should be the target of our impotent criticism, because that's a guaranteed way to waste your energy and seems to be the route you've taken. Because, of course, Yemen is just the tip of the ice berg. Less than a decade ago, we obliterated Libya, a prosperous and beautiful country, rich with millennia of irreplaceable history and human civilization, and we've turned it into an absolutely hell hole. Why? I guess it's just because we're SO addicted to freedom and DAMN it feels good to be a gangster-- I MEAN AMERICAN! Then there's Iraq, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Korea, and on, and on and on and on and on. The criminal justice system is deplorable for everyone -- I agree with you on this, but to pretend that it doesn't disproportionally affect Black Americans is an extremely intense and creepy level of willful ignorance. Just a taste: ""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,"" former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper's writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday. ""You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,"" Ehrlichman said. ""We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."" And this is the tip of the ice berg -- the modern policing system grew directly out of slave-catcher crews. Now this idea that this is ""hands down the best time to be American for any identity group"" is truly revolting. (Feel free to fact check:) Suicide rates are rising dramatically. Mortality rates for white men are rising (for the first time in recorded history). Poverty rates are rising. Folks are trapped in debt at astonishing rates. People work longer hours and thus spend less time with their families and doing what they love. The opioid crisis takes more than 60,000 lives a year. But we've all got iPhones, right? So that makes everything okay? I mean, what in God's name are you ACTUALLY talking about? Do you have any kind of evidence-based argument? Or are you just repeating something you heard Sam Harris say? I'm sorry, I just find this level of blind patriotism to be so, so creepy and disturbing.

Three out of five ICC judges rejected the appeal. > > According to Brichambaut, the decision challenged by the Philippine government is not a decision on jurisdiction, and the issue of the effect of the country’s withdrawal on the court’s jurisdiction was “neither properly raised nor adequately ventilated” before the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber. > > Majority of the ICC judges also found that the Philippines has failed to demonstrate the errors of the pre-trial chamber. > > In January, the court authorized the inquiry, noting the government’s initiative to reexamine drug war killings did “not amount to tangible, concrete and progressive investigative steps.” > Step forward > > Families of drug war victims and human rights groups welcomed the latest move of The Hague-based tribunal. > > Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the ruling of the ICC judges “marks the next step toward justice for victims of ‘drug war’ killings and their families.” > > The Marcos administration should back up its stated commitment to human rights and the fight against impunity by following through on its international legal obligation to cooperate with the court’s investigation,” Lau said. > > Families of victims of “drug war” killings hope the decision of the court’s appeals chamber moves them closer to justice. > > “They look forward to the ICC indicting the 'most responsible': the masterminds and administrators of a cruel and criminal government policy that targeted killing thousands of poor people,” the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers and the Rise Up for Life and for Rights, a coalition of individuals whose loved ones were killed during the anti-drug campaign. > > Officially, 6,252 people were killed in Duterte's ""war on drugs.""

Ronald dela Rosa. > > Human Rights Watch said the timeline for issuing arrest warrants or summonses to appear in an investigation can vary significantly—ranging from just under two months to over six years. > > Once suspects appear before the court, the next step is pre-trial proceedings known as “confirmation of charges.” During these proceedings, ICC judges evaluate the evidence at hand to determine whether there are “substantial grounds” to believe the suspects are responsible for the crimes charged in the indictment. > > If a charge or charges are confirmed, a trial date is scheduled. > > The ICC faces significant hurdles in securing arrests as it lacks its own police force, and must rely on the cooperation of states and the international community to assist in arrests. > > In this particular case, the prospect of anyone being arrested is unlikely as President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. had said he would not cooperate with the ICC. He had called the investigation an interference and attack on the country’s sovereignty. > > Marcos’ justice secretary, Jesus Crispin Remulla, said on the eve of the ICC ruling that they will not implement a warrant should it be issued by the international tribunal. > > Although the Philippines no longer recognizes the ICC after pulling out of the court in 2019, the tribunal still has jurisdiction over crimes committed while the country was a state party. > No more appeal > > Following this dismissal, the Philippines no longer has any recourse for further appeal. > > Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra earlier said the Philippine government “will continue to focus on its own investigation and prosecution” of alleged “drug war” abuses regardless of the outcome of its appeal. > > Guevarra, who was justice secretary during the Duterte administration, filed a notice of appeal on February 3 and asked the ICC to reverse the decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to allow Khan to pursue the investigation.

dvcpeho,badgovnofreedom,"For over a decade, the FBI has been using Best Buy’s Geek Squad workers as confidential human sources, according to documents released Wednesday. The Electronic Frontier Foundation obtained FBI records relating to the agency’s Geek Squad ties through a FOIA lawsuit. EFF contents that such a relationship could mean law enforcement is conducting warrantless searches of Best Buy customers’ computers, circumventing the owners’ Fourth Amendment rights. Best Buy admitted in a statement to PCMag that four of its employees “may have” accepted payments from the FBI in exchange for evidence of possible child porn from customers’ devices. The company wrote that “any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies. Three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned.” The FBI did not provide comment on the issue to PCMag, and refused to confirm or deny agreements with Geek Squad team members to EFF. Last year, the Geek Squad’s role in crime fighting was revealed in the case of Mark Rettenmaier in California. Rettenmaier was slapped with federal possession of child pornography charges after bringing his computer to Best Buy for repair. His attorneys discovered eight Geek Squad technicians who acted as paid informants for the FBI over the course of four years. In response to the case, Best Buy released a statement claiming that “Best Buy and Geek Squad have no relationship with the FBI. From time to time, our repair agents discover material that may be child pornography and we have a legal and moral obligation to turn that material over to law enforcement. We are proud of our policy and share it with our customers before we begin repair.” The company says that roughly 100 times a year, technicians inadvertently find suspected child porn on customer devices. While Best Buy insists their employees are prohibited from searching customer devices beyond “what is necessary to solve the customer’s problem,” EFF points to the Rettenmaier case as evidence that some Geek Squad workers were incentivized by law enforcement to gather further information. In a post on the EFF website, the organization said “the image found on Rettenmaier’s hard drive was in an unallocated space, which typically requires forensic software to find. Geek Squad employees were financially rewarded for finding child pornography. Such a bounty would likely encourage Geek Squad employees to actively sweep for suspicious content.”",Geek Squad employees were financially rewarded for finding child pornography.

Most of the victims of group false accusations have been black men because they were the unsympathetic figures at the time, and to insist Harvey Weinstein is guilty before he has stood trial is to shove a knife in the backs of all those black men in the Jim Crow era that died in prison for crimes they didn't commit because white women wanted to destroy a black man either for some perceived offense or due to their indifference to the suffering of an unsympathetic figure.

cmxle2o,Egalitarianism,"1. Reduce financial barriers to mental health care. Despite recent reforms in the US, mental health coverage is still treated like an elective procedure with a limited amount of coverage of cost/visits per year. Mental health *has* to be addressed like physical health. If you suspect you have a problem, you can go to a clinic for same day treatment at a nominal fee. 2. Increase access to mental health care. Again, despite recent reforms, mental health care is treated as a remote office practice. Physical medicine doctors and mental health doctors travel in different circles, and getting a referral from one to another can be difficult or impossible. You shouldn't have to be forced to hunt around though private practice listings like you're choosing a dentist when you're not right in the head. 3. Raise public awareness about the signs, symptoms, severity, and causes of common mental health problems. *Outside* of drug commercials. I don't see why we could have prime time anti-drug ads running on television throughout the 90s and we can't spare an ounce of public funding to inform and educate about panic attacks, severe depressive episodes, anger issues, anxiety, or stress. 4. Reduce the stigma by proactively changing the narrative. Let's face it, part of our celebrity culture is just a freak show, pointing and laughing at public figures that are going through possible (or even confirmed) medical issues. We wouldn't make fun of an actor for having heart disease, so why is it acceptable to doubt and ridicule a musician who claims to have bipolar disorder? Likewise, when we're faced with acts of terrorism and mass violence, we should not cater to the toxic psychology of giving the perpetrator(s) extensive media coverage about their background and motivations. *Murdering people is a clear sign of mental illness*, as such, the identity and behavior of killers should be a footnote to the tragedy itself and be properly framed as a disturbed person who did not get the appropriate help. 5. Don't just shake your head at the numbers. Particularly in cases of the high rate of soldier suicide, people shake their head and lament about the tragedy of war. **Stop That.** People today have become incredibly passive when it comes to ""how things are"", as though there's nothing that can be done to change the mechanism.

epokl3q,Egalitarianism,"I work in mental health, and that gives me at least some insight into the populations you find in homeless shelters. From what I can tell, a substantial portion of them (in men's shelters, at least) are men being released directly from prison. If they don't have family willing to take them in, they're just sent to a homeless shelter. Now, it's important to note that society doesn't tend to think of male convicts as ""people with mental health problems."" They're just ""bad men."" The reality is, of course, that these men *do* have mental health problems. The vast majority of them have been abused and neglected as children, which leaves them open to being inducted into gang cultures, and they're frequently not even given a choice about it: joining a gang is just one of the things these men often have to do to survive. The majority of these men qualify for diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder—providing you have an enlightened view of the diagnostic criteria, as there is a good deal of evidence at this point that men do not always present their depression in the same way women/other men do. But I've treated plenty of these guys; if you dig deep, it becomes patently clear they are horribly depressed and even suicidal in some cases. It is beyond common for retired gangsters to succumb to major substance abuse and simply wither away until dead. Most of the ones I've seen who've made it to 40 don't live to see 60. They use instant-gratification methods like alcohol and other drugs to numb their pain, which causes them tremendous health problems that eventually kill them at a relatively young age. Much of what feminists claim is ""toxic masculinity"" really has nothing to do with traditional gender norms for men, so much as it does societal neglect of men (male disposability). Had these men not been neglected, the very traits feminists cite as ""toxic"" (e.g. stoicism, independence, even aggression) are channeled into positive outlets. Really, gender norms only become toxic when coupled with societal neglect, and you see the same thing in women: neglected women become catty and manipulative, and use their sex appeal for selfish ends (all forms of toxic femininity).

The mirror of this is the cultural assumption that women *aren't* smart and *don't* have all the answers, leading to men explaining things to women when those women know more about the subject than they do. There are certainly women who try to explain things they don't understand, but these cultural pressures lead to a disproportionately large number of men exhibiting this behaviour. *Mansplaining* is a term coined by women to describe this frequent thing that men do, explaining things to them that the men don't understand or that the women already know. The difference between this term and the phrase *get back in the kitchen* is that the latter doesn't refer to a specific behaviour or cultural phenomenon, it is used solely to silence and harass women.

If you want a more solid example, I can give you one from my own experience. One of my jobs is as an instructor at a rock climbing gym. There's a type of guy we get coming in to climb, the kind of guy who's never climbed before and yet apparently knows everything there is to know about rock climbing. He will say things, often to women in the group, like.. ""The tape colours tell you the difficulty of the climb. [X colour] is the hardest."" (The colours are random. The numbers written at the bottom tell you the difficulty.) ""Reach up for that big hold!"" (Wtf? She'll be over extended if she goes for that hold, she needs to move her feet up, *always* move your feet if you can.) ""Climbing is all about upper body strength, you have to do pushups and pullups and weight training to get good."" (Climbing is about lower body coordination, forearm muscle and finger tendon strength, and cardio. Excessive muscle makes you heavy, being heavy burns you out.) ""The clips make you go slower so the climb is harder."" (They're called quickdraws and they're so that people can lead climb, and/or so the climber doesn't swing and hurt themselves if they fall.) ""When you get to the top of the autobelay there's a button to push to lower you."" (You just let go whenever you want to come down.) ""There are two slots in the [whatever he thinks the belay device is called] so that you can hold two people."" (They're for repelling, you can't belay two people unless you have four arms.) I've almost never had a woman do this in one of my groups, yet men and teenage boys do it constantly. The most frustrating part is that I'm left in the position of either calling this person out and embarrassing them, or leaving the members of the group with inaccurate information, in some cases information that directly hinders their ability to climb well. Once in a while the guy will go so far as to incorrectly explain how to set up the climbing harness, which could potentially get the climber or a person on the ground underneath them killed.

i9saef0,MayDayStrike,"Do you even know what a straw man is? Saying I created a straw-man suggests I’m attacking something based on a misrepresentation of that thing, and I have not misrepresented anything since I did not generalize all men as being that way, and the group I did accuse of being that way are evidenced to be that way. I didn’t “create” it out of “thin air”. Women get raped every day, by randos and even by their partners and spouses. This is especially true in partnerships and marriages where a woman withholds sex from their spouse or partner. Maybe in your experience its is not a concern, but for many women it is a legitimate concern. If you think something could potentially be dangerous based on evidence that it is statistically dangerous, wouldn’t you be cautious? You treat an unloaded gun like its loaded because the consequences of being mistaken about the gun being loaded are worth preventing. If a woman has to risk her wellbeing to have sex, why would she have sex? Her partner doesn’t have the right to ask her to risk her wellbeing for his pleasure, the woman’s decision about her own wellbeing should always remain with her. But men don’t always agree with that, and that is not limited to strangers or date rape. Husbands and long term partners are also perpetrators, and sometimes those cases go unreported. How are we supposed to predict whether the person we married is going to rape us if we withhold sex? Its not a matter of religion, political leanings, stature, or otherwise, since we see all different kinds of men rape us. You don’t want us to assume all men are capable of rape, but how else are we supposed to be sure of our own safety when the scripts are often flipped? Many women have had their loving husbands or partners, who are “incapable of harm”, and who have fathered their children, rape them out of nowhere. They are not owed sex any more than a stranger on the street or in a bar. As far as welfare... Im an unmarried financially independent woman, and taxes are removed from my check for welfare too. And I am good with that because I’m not a selfish prick who takes my privilege for granted. You should consider yourself lucky, some people are systematically oppressed and intentionally kept impoverished. In the future when you are old and decrepit and relying in part on social security and other welfare programs to survive, you’d do well to remember that you are living off the backs of women’s work too. Or worse yet, if one day you face financial ruin, are unable to work, and are relying completely on welfare to survive, you should remember that people advocated for the taxes that allow you the ability to survive as a poor person. You call us whores for having sex, what better are you unless you are celibate or an incel? Because you have a penis? No, you are just on the same misogynistic power trip men have been on since the beginning. Whether they are conservative or liberal, men rape. Don’t think you are morally superior to other men because you have some made up value system you can barely follow. Whether you rape or not, you are part of the problem because you continue to objectify women and contribute to their dehumanization and oppression. But you don’t care, in fact it’s probably what you want. Edit: to be clear.... nothing, **absolutely nothing**, gives a person the right to decide what another person does with their own body. Sex is not immoral, it is a simple biological process and has no real moral value outside of the moral value it was given by men to keep women subdued. To rape is to violate bodily autonomy, and to force a woman to keep that baby is is own violation of autonomy as well as a further perpetuation of that original violation. Women should, at the very least, not have to live with the consequences of some men’s inability to control themselves. Why not refocus your ridiculous efforts to violate women’s bodily autonomy to actually helping people who have already been born and are actually suffering in the real world? Oh wait, you don’t want to because they are of a different ethnicity, class, sexuality, or gender. Where do those superior conservative morals you boasted about go when they don’t serve your agenda?

ihpqpv1,MayDayStrike,"Last week, I posted about Evan Seyfried ([ an exemplary employee of Kroger for two decades who took his own life on March 9, 2021, due to prolonged psychological abuse from two store managers. According to *The Washington Post* ([ in a ""wrongful death"" lawsuit, Evan's family alleges his death resulted from a six-month harassment campaign by two co-workers at the Milford, Ohio, location — ""a campaign dedicated to ousting Evan while proclaiming her \[his boss'\] intention to make Evan's life a 'living hell.'"": * A supervisor allegedly harassed him for wearing a face mask during COVID and made fun of him for his political beliefs, calling him ""antifa."" * Evan reported several unwanted sexual advances toward him, which resulted in no response from management after he reported them. * After hearing reports from neighbors, Evan believed co-workers who his supervisors pitted against him followed him home and waited on the street for long periods of time. * Evan allegedly received threats, including a supervisor allegedly telling him he could track his Internet usage. * Evan's repeated reports to both management and the union resulted in no meaningful action. In fact, Kroger denied a transfer to another store. * After Evan helped two female employees file sexual harassment complaints against a supervisor, he received texts with child sexual abuse materials. * Co-workers allegedly sabotaged his audit by replacing product with outdated product. * Supervisors wrote Evan up nine times despite never before receiving a reprimand in this nearly two-decade career. He feared he would be fired. * Fearing for his safety, Evan moved in with his parents. Before quitting, Evan worried about the audit, his phone monitoring, and the plan to frame him for possessing child sexual abuse materials. ""I think that was a lot of what triggered his spiral because he thought he was going to end up in jail for something he didn't do,"" said Amy Chamberlin, Seyfried's girlfriend. Kroger failed to act in accordance with their own complaint policies while violating Evan's inherent right to dignity. The mobbing Evan endured was not only egregious but also dehumanizing.

hrzhwiv,MayDayStrike,"Well your mom is partially right, labor is almost always the most expensive part of a company's expenses. If the cost of that labor rises, especially in industries with smaller than average profit margins, they either need to raise costs or they'll eventually run out of money. Where I think she's wrong though is that companies know that consumers are very price sensitive, you may not think you are, but you probably just don't realize it. Dan Ariely's ""predictably irrational"" is a good starting point for this type of stuff, but anyways if implemented overnight prices will rise initially but then companies will begin to think ""hey if we price our product just like $0.40 cheaper, we can increase our profits by 15%"". With juicy profits on the line, they'll be put into what I call a ""not my problem"" box. One of my first jobs was with a moving company, the owner would constantly task us with impossible assignments like move this 1400 lbs safe up to the 3rd floor with just 2 guys or tow this 20 foot boat with this tiny kia that didn't even have a trailer hitch. When asked how the fuck were we supposed to do that, he'd just respond with ""not my problem, find a way"" and he'd hang up. And most of the time we did find a way, it wasn't pretty or efficient but the job got done. For a long time workers have been saying ""i can't afford to live on this wage"" and companies have just said ""not my problem, find a way"" so people would get 2nd jobs or just get by however they can. A higher minimum wage moves the ""not my problem"" from the worker, over to the employer. They'll find a way, maybe it won't be pretty or efficient, they may fire some people, close certain stores, bring in more robots, but before they do any of that they'll probably first try spending less on advertising, sponsoring sports stadiums, ""public awareness"" donations, overpriced conference rooms nobody uses, maybe introduce more remote work roles to cut down on office space, reduce compensation at the top end, etc. Now that's not the be the case for everything, if you need your car's oil changed and the guy has to get down in the hole, get oil all over himself, and work out in the weather elements for $20/hour if starbucks is paying $25/hour he may say fuck it and quit or demand his boss pays him $30/hour to put up with all that shit, well now your oil change will probably cost $55 instead of $45.","One of my first jobs was with a moving company, the owner would constantly task us with impossible assignments like move this 1400 lbs safe up to the 3rd floor with just 2 guys or tow this 20 foot boat with this tiny kia that didn't even have a trailer hitch.

j1owvyn,neurodiversity,"For me the shock of learning about my autism threw me into the same boat. I was elated that I had a name to hang my uniqueness on, but my relationship with my parents, already tenuous, disintegrated completely once I realised they knew all this time. The way I found out was when the psychologist asked about early schooling and I mentioned a ""motor perception class."" He ordered tests and sure enough I was on the spectrum. He then dropped the bomb:""your parents knew of your autism then. else you wouldn't have been in that class."" Then it dawned on me that they sent me to a private religious school for the sole purpose of keeping me off the shortbus -- *their appearance to be kept up was far more important than my developmental well-being*.

The way I conquer it is to constantly have many projects that can wait, but provide idle down time for when I need it.

The trick is that I must be able to start the task anywhere and end it anywhere, and it has to be enjoyable for downtime -- I must be able to get lost in it and fall down rabbit holes gathering info about it. Examples: with the music database, I make sure all my files are turned up in volume so the volume doesn't jump when they play back. It takes about 5 minutes to process an hour's worth of music.

Because of the sensory processing issue, I also have a difficulty with identifying sounds and often misunderstand verbal information (subtitles save my day).

h29qc7z,neurodiversity,"Oh man, reading what you wrote hit me hard. TLDR: Legit don't get how people handle jobs that don't fit what they enjoy doing or caters to their strengths. Mental health support, long term disability, lowering expectations of going about things the ""normal"" way, and finding work that mostly fits my needs so I can do acting and voice over and other creative things while go to school to pursue my major passion(s) is how I handle it and I'm approaching this now. Hopefully something here is helpful for you. Lol I've worked in customer service for 10 years now. Retail, sales, cashier, ailes associate, call center agent, etc. Can't keep a job for more than a year before I have to quit, or I end up being fired or forced to quit earlier because my health deteriorates so badly from having to mask, handle the sensory overload, and work on tasks in ways that goes against how I process information and function that I have panic attacks, meltdowns at work, lose of ability to meet basic needs, and eventually lead to full on burnout. I'm not sure what advice I can really give, since I'm still struggling with this myself. Having mental health supports have been the biggest help for myself. I now have better ideas of what under/overstimutes my senses and ways to keep things level or reduce overload so I don't have meltdowns so frequently, neat tricks to stim that look more normal but give me what I need. Having someone to talk to about social interactions so I don't ruminate over situations or can get a different opinion on the interactions that occur to analyze on, and not beat myself up so much over not doing more or being good enough to keep down a job has also been extremely helpful. Also, having someone just, tell me that I'm doing my best and validate my feelings and experiences and see the struggles I go through and never judge or get upset with me....I don't really have words to explain just how much that alone had helped. Besides that, being on long term disability has taken a relatively big weight off my hands with working and has been the other biggest help for me. I still need to find work, because where I live the price of rent is usually $1400 for a small 1 bedroom, but instead of forcing myself to work full-time and deal with the consequences of that, I can find work that is part time and be able to focus more on my health and recovery from work and passions. I'm currently on some waitlists for government subsidized housing, so if I end up getting into a place and have it so my rent is cut down more, that's a even bigger weight out my shoulders. As for the work itself....well, thanks to the pandemic and not working for over a year, I'm done trying to put myself into metaphorical boxes that I don't fit in. If I gotta take some temporary part time job that keeps the food on the table, fine, but I don't aim to try to stick it out in any part time job that doesn't excite or challenge me and work with my strengths. Right now going into an employment program that will help me find work that tailors to my needs short term so I don't keep experiencing burnout so frequently, and ideally help me find a way so I can have work long term that goes with my passions and strengths. If things all pan out, I'll be able to start working in the acting and film making industry and build my voice over portfolio, take time to start livestreaming, and go back to school to start pursuing a degree in psychology, while having work that somewhat is aligned with these. Again, I don't know if any of my experiences or choices in handling my situation(s) is helpful as advice for yourself, but the one thing I do want to say at least is that you're absolutely not alone in this. Customer service just blows. :P","Oh man, reading what you wrote hit me hard. TLDR: Legit don't get how people handle jobs that don't fit what they enjoy doing or caters to their strengths.

h17u249,neurodiversity,"Well said! I was also recently diagnosed last year at 44 as part of my appeal for SSDI and getting that diagnosis was like someone turning a light on. It would have been nice if I'd been diagnosed earlier so I'd have been able to access accomodations through school and in my career so I wouldn't have burned out to the point where I literally couldn't work anymore, but it didn't. So I volunteer now, well not during quarantine - but I did prior to the pandemic and loved it. I also came to the realization during this process that yeah, there aren't many people who are a good fit for me friendship-wise and that's OK! For a long time I viewed it as a failing on my part because that's all I'd ever heard no matter what happened, so I'd let people walk all over me thinking that if I just never talked about anything that bothered me but always lent a sympathetic ear/offered support I'd be able to make friends... I know how that sounds *now,* but I think I had to go through it to understand it. 9/10 I lost the connections I did because people simply weren't willing to respect my boundaries and that behavior is not conducive to a healthy connection. I've been working lately to focus on the fact that I do have healthy, supportive, and caring long-standing in-person friendships. I don't have a ""lot"" whatever that means, but off the top of my head I can think of 4 including my husband who I've been with for 15 years and knows me 'warts and all.' And to be honest, I've reached the point after realizing how much time/energy I've wasted over the years due to masking, where I really am OK with that. I'm delighted to just focus on learning who I am, what I want, and healing from multiple decades of either having to hide who I am or continuously having my experiences, existence, etc. invalidated by people who told me they cared for me.  #x200B; OP your daughter is extremely lucky to have you as her mom and an advocate because you have direct experience with some of the hurdles she will face.

Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Since NY is a pretty populous, well-connected place, you can probably go to a psychiatrist relatively easily.

ijfofpl,neurodiversity,"Personal anecdotes/examples of the 3: My fiancé (M, 24) is autistic and he has special interests, hyper-fixations, and normal interests. His psychiatrist also believes he has ADHD but that is not formally diagnosed yet. I (F,24) have ADHD and OCD and have a very different experience regarding personal interests than he does. He has told me that it’s like in his brain he has a heads up display and his special interests and current fixations are literally always there. His primary special interest is a video game called Overwatch. He will take any opportunity ever to play Overwatch — l cannot think of a single thing he would choose over it. When it first came out he latched on immediately and became hyper fixated. Several years later there has been no dwindling whatsoever of his enthusiasm and preoccupation with this game (rather the opposite — the more he learns and plays and gathers info about it the more he loves it!). When he is not playing the game he is on twitter engaging with a community of others who play it, or on YouTube streaming watching other people play it (or engaging w Overwatch content of some sort in multiple ways at the same time lol). If he doesn’t get time on any given day to play Overwatch he feels very emotionally dysregulated and gets more irritable and feels preoccupied by thoughts and desires to play the game. He thinks about it all day and it is often his primary motivator for getting anything done (bc once he does it then he can play Overwatch). It is very stimulating and grounding for him and he feels like it really uses all of the disparate parts of his brain harmoniously. This is a long term special interest and we have to take real action to ensure he prioritizes necessary life things like chores work relationships etc enough because otherwise he will pretty much just play Overwatch. Another more manageable special interest of his is Latin as well as the ancient civilizations and mythology. He studied these topics, competed nationally in Latin, knows absolutely everything there is to know about the topics and even though he knows them he listens to information, podcasts, sleep stories, etc about Latin and about Ancient history etc every single day. It is certainly a special interest of his, he is very very passionate and pointedly interested in it, and he will tie it in to convos or bring it up often, but it does not preoccupy him the same way his primary special interest does. It doesn’t create issues the way him prioritizing Overwatch can create issues. Same with Ice Hockey. He absolutely loves it and it’s a core part of his life and he sees the world through the lens of having been a hockey player — but it gets set aside for Overwatch. On another tier, he is deeply interested in a lot of things and is a learner by heart —he wants to know everything about everything. His degree of interest in anything he’s interested in seems to be more intense than most people but don’t generally preoccupy him. For example, he likes to cook and when he’s cooking or preparing to cook he is enjoying it and pays detailed attention to it and cooks zealously— it can sustain his attention and he enjoys it. However, 99% of the time he’s not thinking about cooking. He’s thinking about Overwatch, another special interest, or a current hyper fixation. Same with photography. He is very interested in it, knowledgeable about it, etc. but it is clearly on the level of a hobby. Another special interest of his is cars. He has been very passionately enthusiastic about cars since he was a little kid and his first word was car and 3rd was Porsche. His special interest growing up was cars — hot wheels, racing games, etc. These days he is still extremely interested in cars but he doesn’t usually consume car related content daily or for prolonged periods of time. Recently he’s been looking at getting a new car. So now he’s in a period of an abnormal degree of hyper-fixation on this interest. This means 24/7 everything has to do with his search for a new car or with playing Overwatch. It takes significant planning and effort for him to get other things done and he’s often very frustrated and on edge about not being able to have enough special interest time. Same with dogs — he’s extremely interested in dogs and feels a deep need for the companionship from a dog. He has always loved them but hasn’t always talked about them regularly. Right now, however, he’s currently looking into getting a dog, so that is taking up a TON of his time and attention. He often gets so hyper fixated on it it seems like everything in the world revolves around it even when we have time sensitive tasks or other places our attention needs to go. He goes down rabbit holes of looking at breeds that don’t make sense for our lifestyle because he gets fixated on one trait of that breed that he likes then researches it very fully despite the rest of the traits not remotely lining up with the brief. He’ll come to me after hours of researching with a “great” idea to get xyz type of dog for me to then be like ... honey I think you forgot about all of these criteria we discussed? This doesn’t fit any of them? And he’s devastated. That often happens when he (and I!) gets hyper fixated — losing track of what is within reasonable bounds and forgetting about core criteria as well as inflexible thinking and inability to redirect attention. I get fixated on all kinds of things all the time to the degree where i really lose track of time and am often hyper fixated on things I’m not even remotely interested in or that don’t make sense of my time or even can harm me (rabbit holes into dark topics etc.). I do have tons of interests, some long term some fleeting, I call them passions or enthusiasms usually. My passions are long term and my enthusiasms aren’t short lived in my interest in them but they’re short lived in my engagement with them — I may always be interested in that thing but not compelled to really engage with it, I just happen to find it interesting. Even though I have tons of interests i’m often bored and don’t know what to do to entertain myself bc my interests don’t always sound compelling enough to put in the effort to engage with them. This is NOT an experience my fiancé has — if he is remotely bored he has his special interest and he plays it and he is happy to do so and that is his interest that is what he does. He is passionate about a long list of things as well as prone to hyper fixation on certain things— generally only on his special interests. Some of them capture his attention way too much to the extent that it is highly abnormal and effectively a long term fixation. Others draw him in to where he loses track of time and becomes hyper-fixated but don’t rule his life for long. And others are more “normal” in that he likes them but engages with them as they come up in convo or life and generally doesn’t seek them out when they don’t. Edit: grammar/fleshing out thoughts. Sorry this is a bit unstructured and messy!!",So now he‚Äôs in a period of an abnormal degree of hyper-fixation on this interest.

co16tx4,Dyslexia,"When it comes to people believing someone has a problem it seems parents and teachers are normally the two last ones that will accept there is a problem. A lot of parents seems to believe that dyslexia or any learning disabilities doesn't apply to their children. It's almost like they can't fathom the thought. This is me just talking from my experiences. When dyslexia is brought up then they believe this means we are stupid even though it far from the truth. What's worst is a lot of people believe this. One of the things you could try is do some research and sit down with your parents and show it to them. Then tell them you have a problem, that it may not be dyslexia but could be something and that you need help. Hear is a link to help you get started.  Teachers don't like the term. They feel as soon as it comes up they ether failed or the person isn't going to do well. Some even think dyslexia means lazy or stupid because they don't understand it nor care to. Schools often would rather this go undiagnosed because they don't know how to deal with it and they rather just pretend your lazy. There is no cure for dyslexia. For the speech part of it I went to a therapist. I had to learn to think how I am going to say a word before I talk so I wouldn't stutter. Something like this could help you. When it comes to dyslexia, if you have it, it's best to learn a few tricks from other dyslexics than someone who doesn't have it.

egwg3rd,Dyslexia,"I believe you have a misunderstanding what dyslexia is. It is a hereditary trait commonly caused by gene KIAA0319. This causes issues with language and working memory parts of the brain and was proven by fMRI studies.   Every time I see a video about dyslexia they are assuming based on what someone with dyslexia has problems with or someone with dyslexia trying to relate to the normal people with a view of their hardship. Both can't see the diffrnce with out a cure or treatment and believe me there are some out there that work but are limited and illigal in some cases.   There is no known cure for dyslexia. Most ""cures"" were from faked studies by the Dore group and all were debunked by NASA and BDA. Most people that took the Dore program were threatened with lawsuits if they disclosed it didn't work with their child.  Let's talk about vision, you have two eyes, that gather light data and your brain processes it in to movement and patterns.  The first field is your visual, the perefiral vision we can all see, so things in the corner of your eye drawing attention. The second field is kind of invisable, this is your patten recognition, it's what tells your brain when you look at something what it is, from a thing color or word.  Dyslexia have a very narrow pattern recognition field when it comes to recognizing words and for most of us it's limited to a single word of text maybe 4 to 8 letters.   Dyslexia has been proven to not be a visual problem nor is it seeing in a narrow pattern. This is why blind people can have dyslexia. There was one account of a person and their family having symmetrical spots in their eyes but what the media posted is extravaganted because it was on out of 30 and that person family who they did not do a dyslexia testing on.   Look at the text you're reading here pay attention to one word then try to read the top of the page without moving your center of view.   This is peripheral vision and also has nothing to do with dyslexia.  Perception for a normal person they may be able to understand every word on a phone and even see the hairs on their hand as they text.  This is where patter recognition comes in,  It's like playing a video game in 4k and getting all that juicy detail but dyslexia means you play on a potato monitor.   Actually this is a false statement. Visually dyslexics are the same as non dyslexics. Some dyslexics can think in 3D and can have really good spatial thinking. So dyslexic would be a 4k monitor with a great graphics card but not so great cpu.  Now what may cause dyslexic symptoms has never really been spoken about in a way i am going to talk about and I really hope some research is put in to it,   Symptoms have been documented in great detail.  The brain is just an organ or a motor it's fueled by o2 which is drawn in by lungs producing a static charge to make the mucsels respond and we are packed with a lot of then, even our eyes have contractual musciels. The spine in turns takes these signals and connects the body to the brain. I recently had problems with vision due to a neck problem and tunnel vision was a factor, it was far worse because I was finding it hard to read and I didn't know why, lost a job stopped dreaming and was lost on the cause at the time. When the spinal cord is moved it can tug on the brain stem and some of the very small nerves get pinched, this could lead to any symptoms, deffness blindness, lost of taste, color blindness. The factors are pretty huge. I am no way a doctor I have had experence of the mechanical changes in the body when the spine is put under pressure and thus my account.   Dyslexia =/= tunnel vision. It also isnt related to spinal cord issue.  So I heard about a thing called spinal tethering, it's where the cord can be pinched at a point in the spine causing tightness and lack of mobility but can effect the brain function as well.  Think of a split in the head phone cable when you get audio only in one ear peace and you constantly jiggle the cord till it works again.    What if this could be a cause for some of our symptoms, not all of us but if I'm right even a visit to a chiropractor could change your life with a few treatments.    Hopfuly this helps people understand some things I may try explain more in a video at some point if I get comfortable talking openly about it.   I hope you do a little more research before making claims. I dont believe there is any research that indicates dyslexia is a spinal issue nor a visual. We do have a library you can access from our side bar.",I believe you have a misunderstanding what dyslexia is. It is a hereditary trait commonly caused by gene KIAA0319.

dybu1gq,Dyslexia,The answers are from my point of view. I'm in my 30's. What other learning challenges can be face along with dyslexia? well more times than not i get it before it's Taught to me once it's taught i lose it and it can be a struggle. and it's not all the time. i feel like my issues only come up when they want to and i have no control over them. i will say even if i'm excited to learn abut something if my brain don't want to work well that day. it can have a huge impact emotionally and someimtes helps me lose motivation. How can dyslexia affect a person's communication and social skills?  - for me i think this is huge. my ideas are crazy due to me not thinking like most other people i see different connetions and patters. Thus small talk pointing out the given seems like a waste of time. (althought i could be a little selfish) but it's way to difficult for me to have converstations or even come up with question to keep people talking. Other times tho since i'm out going i can nail it. Practice tho. and somedays the added work it takes to do basic things like texting (spelling is my hard one) makes it hard to be active on social media because everyone judges you and you can only say shut up so many times before it becomes not worth the effort. How do you know that you have dyslexia or you just have a hard time processing material? about 29 years ago i was tested for a learning disability i am intelligent just can't show that to normal folks due to my what they called then LD and what other drs told me growing up is now dyslexia. I struggled a lot in school. but knew all the answers. if presented correctly. Is it possible to out grow dyslexia or is it something that you live with for the rest of your life?  -- life long -- i will say there is a high chance you learn yourself and find ways to cope and make it better so you feel as if you don't have it. Thats my path most people are not aware i have a disablity. even at work. with spell check and the ablity to have options to call and ask verse typing and asking. it does take me a bit longer to do basic things. no one seems to say i have a disablity because of it. When a student feels down because they have dyslexia how does the school take action?  -- my school never took action and frankly i don't feel it's the schools job. its your life you need to take action. one thing this has taught me is i can count on me. just can't expect others to treat me how i treat me.,about 29 years ago i was tested for a learning disability i am intelligent just can't show that to normal folks due to my what they called then LD and what other drs told me growing up is now dyslexia.

gas3prs,Dyslexia,"This lines up with my own experience nicely and would certainly deserve more research. I've stumbled upon similar techniques long ago by accident. The indication that I didn't in fact ""outgrow"" dyslexia, as it was believed happens when I was a child, was when I started learning a third language from scratch as I was trying to ""go slow and sound it out"" when reading. I was frustrated to see all my long gone issues surface again. Granted, German with its agglutination might be quite close to dyslectic hell, especially for an adult learner (although I feel like I don't have a right to complain after seeing written Finnish). I have tall plans for the future. It would be interesting to see whether I have similar issues with different scripts, like Cyrillic for example. I'm nowhere near an actual speed-reader, especially not in English, which is (technically) my second language, but I do read pretty fast compared to most other people.","It would be interesting to see whether I have similar issues with different scripts, like Cyrillic for example.

homaprz,Dyslexia,"I only felt different when I was in Special Ed spaces. It was *very* clear to me that my issues were not the same as the kids with intellectual disabilities and serious social issues. I don't mean like, I thought I was superior to them. I mean, I could read better than the kid with down syndrome, and do a *lot* more advanced math than he could. I didn't try to run away from school, or lock myself in bathrooms, or use an aid. My issues were not the same as their issues. So in those spaces, I *wanted* to be different, and isolated from the other students. What was uncomfortable for me wasn't feeling different. It was the idea that I *should* feel like the kid with Down Syndrome-- that we were the same because of our disabilities, when we so clearly *weren't.* I learned to pass as able and avoid being seen in Special Ed spaces to maintain that sense of separation. If you've lived through Special Ed at a public school, you probably understand what I'm talking about. But just to illustrate why this would've been such an issue for me, there's this one scene in a show called *Fresh Off the Boat* [where the principal tries to push the main character to be friends with a new kid because they're both Chinese.]( This is what would happen to me. The special ed staff would push me to be friends with somebody who had like, high-impact autism, and then behave like that principal does, because ""you're both in Special Ed, so you're exactly the same!"" Even though, again, the other kid would have serious autism. (And nothing in common with me.) I didn't like that. I didn't like the idea that people saw me as *far* less capable than I actually was, and that's why I wanted to be different and isolated from the other Special Ed kids. When I wasn't in Special Ed, I *never* felt like my dyslexia made me different. If I felt different or isolated from my able classmates, it was because I had food allergies and strict conservative parents. Not because I was dyslexic. That's probably because I'm so good at ""passing"" as able. My classmates really didn't know about my dyslexia, and the only kids who knew I was in Special Ed were the other kids in Special Ed. (Again, you may know this since you're dyslexic, but the ""higher functioning"" kids in Special Ed tend to have an unspoken ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy when it comes to talking about being in Special Ed.) But the end result was, I never was made to feel different or isolated because of my dyslexia. . Now, I *did* feel unwelcome at times. But that was the teachers. Not my classmates. I was born a year after the current ADA went into effect, so getting teachers on board with IEPs and stuff was hard. Some of those teachers did things that would be classified as child abuse today, *purely* because of my IEP. And it was especially bad because I was ""Twice Gifted"" (learning disabled and smart.) Nobody liked the ""Twice Gifted"" students. The Special Ed teachers felt you were too smart to deserve any extra help. The regular teachers felt you were too smart for their class (the implication being if you would just stop being lazy and apply yourself, you'd be in the Gifted classes.) And the Gifted teachers made it overwhelmingly clear they thought you were too stupid to be in their class. My AP chemistry teacher told me, to my face, he didn't know why the school let ""you people"" (IEP kids) in APs because it apparently never goes well. (Looking back, I think it might have gone better if he hadn't been such an ass about my extra time, or if he stopped going out of his way to ding me for sig figs, or if he hadn't withheld assignments I missed while sick and caused me to get a week's worth of zeros....) So I have a lot of repressed anger at schools, and teacher unions. (I know unions are important. But they're also the reason why my 5th grade teacher wasn't fired even though she tried to force me to let my blood sugar crash and then wanted to punish me for sneaking down to the school office and calling my mom for help.) I can't legally do anything about it, because the statute of limitations is looooong passed, but I'm working on figuring out a way to encourage my former schools to treat their disabled students better than they treated me. I also try to respond to posts here when I can, in hopes that maybe I can use some of my anger for something constructive.","It was *very* clear to me that my issues were not the same as the kids with intellectual disabilities and serious social issues.

hwj9m1i,FreeSpeech,"here's a translated article, just in case you're interested in opposing opinion: Fact check: Are mRNA injections vaccinations or gene therapy? According to the German government's plans, mandatory vaccination will soon be introduced. But what kind of substances are we talking about exactly? Politicians and the media say that the novel mRNA preparations - such as ""Comirnaty"" from Biontech - are vaccines, which would therefore be subject to similar rules and legal regulations as other well-known and long-established vaccinations. Critics, on the other hand, say they are ""gene therapies"" that are called vaccines only to avoid stricter legal regulation and high licensing hurdles. Which is true? PAUL SCHREYER, Dec. 3, 2021, 23 comments, PDF Vaccination is a positive thing, it keeps you healthy, and it's necessary - many people are sure of that, especially during the Corona crisis. Although the mRNA technology now being used is a new procedure, it can be evaluated on the basis of the extensive experience gained with other vaccinations over the past years and decades. The risk is manageable. In addition, an obligation to use mRNA preparations (""compulsory vaccination"") is legally within the bounds of what is permissible - after all, there is already compulsory vaccination against measles. However, assessments by several experts are now casting doubt on this view. For example, Stefan Oelrich, a member of the Bayer Board of Management, recently commented on mRNA preparations in a way that raises fundamental questions. Oelrich is head of the Bayer Group's drug division, which last year achieved global sales of 17 billion euros under his responsibility. He spoke at the opening of the annual World Health Summit in Berlin on October 24, alongside the German health minister, the WHO director, the EU Commission president and the UN secretary-general. In his welcoming speech, Oelrich acknowledged: ""The mRNA vaccines are an example of cell and gene therapy. If we had done a public survey two years ago and asked who would be willing to take gene or cell therapy and have it injected into their bodies, probably 95 percent of people would have said no. This pandemic has opened a lot of people's eyes to innovation in a way that wasn't possible before."" As a result, the mRNA injections are not a vaccination in the sense the term has been used. According to Oelrich, they are gene therapy, which until recently was highly controversial. Other experts also see it that way. On November 2, a week after Oelrich's statement in Berlin, a panel of experts met in Washington at the invitation of Senator Ron Johnson to assess the campaign to administer the mRNA preparations. Among the invited experts was Peter Doshi, professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland and an editor at The BMJ magazine, also known as the British Medical Journal, one of the world's most prestigious medical journals. Doshi stated at the meeting: ""I am one of those academics who takes the view that these mRNA products that everyone calls 'vaccines' are qualitatively different from standard vaccines. I found it amazing to learn that the Merriam-Webster dictionary changed the definition of 'vaccine' earlier this year. mRNA products did not meet the definitional criteria for a vaccine that Merriam-Webster had for 15 years. However, the definition was expanded so that mRNA products are now considered vaccines."" Merriam-Webster's dictionaries are the equivalent of the Duden dictionary in English. In fact, the definition there was changed accordingly in January 2021, at the start of the global vaccination campaign (here are the entries before, and after the change). Doshi tied the following question to this: ""How would you feel about a Covid vaccine requirement if we didn't call these preparations 'vaccines'? What if these injections were called drugs instead? The scenario then is, 'We have this drug and we have evidence that it doesn't prevent infection or stop virus transmission.' But the drug is supposed to reduce the risk of becoming severely ill and dying from covid. Would you take a dose of this drug every six months, possibly for the rest of your life, if that's what it took to keep the drug effective? And would you not only take the drug yourself, but also support a legal requirement that everyone else take the drug as well? Or would you say: Wait a minute - if that's all the medicine can do, why don't we use normal medicine instead, like we usually do when we're sick and want to get better? And why make taking it mandatory? The point is: Just because we call it a vaccine, we shouldn't assume that these new products are the same as all other childhood vaccines that are mandatory. Every product is something different. If people are OK with making something mandatory just because it's a vaccine and we're making other vaccines mandatory, I think it's time to bring some critical thinking to this discussion."" Change in law made gene therapy a ""vaccination""","And would you not only take the drug yourself, but also support a legal requirement that everyone else take the drug as well?

d0fo2lr,prochoice,"You clearly have no idea about current reproductive health issues if you genuinely think that there are US states without significant efforts underway or already completed to undermine reproductive freedom. ""Absolutely no threat"" is an absurd thing to say. That's why it just got ""lol."", it didn't deserve more than that. Really? Are there serious efforts to restrict or ban abortion in Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, and California?   That's a nice irrelevant hypothetical. Aren't some children sufficiently supported only with income from one parent, though?   What if that single parent decides to return or refuse child support payments? Then my same question here will still apply, no?   One of the main purposes of legislation is to provide a minimum floor that things will not fall below, bringing up the fact that some people may be in a better situation is not nearly as important. Couldn't welfare still provide this, though?   You've been dancing around this recently. You don't ""become"" either side, you have beliefs and ethical guidelines that define what you find acceptable. Yes, but these beliefs and ethical guidelines can be changed.   Someone can not care about abortion rights while also being pro choice, it's the default position. Acting like a child and threatening to go to the other side unless people play the games you want to play is absurd. Strawman; after all, I *never* threatened to join the other side. Rather, I said that I might very well become pro-life *if* I will accept the positions of some/many pro-choicers on things such as responsibility and personhood. However, I also think that it is unlikely that I will actually accept the positions of these pro-choicers on responsibility and personhood.   Because effort and resources are finite. If I got a minor scratch on my arm, should I be provided with equal care, both in speed, investment, and attentiveness, as a person who has been shot and needs immediate surgery? No, of course not!   If you're arguing for a utopian situation, great, but it's certainly odd that you only seem to be arguing about it when it's something that personally influences you. We do not live in a utopia, we have to prioritize the things that receive resources. OK.   How often have you posted about how the maternal rate of mortality and morbidity could be lowered? You conveniently ignore significant issues on one side and instead focus on a very small issue for yourself, by comparison. What about simply doing what Western European countries do in regards to this, though? After all, don't Western European countries have a *much* lower maternal mortality rate than the U.S. has?   If we lived in a perfect utopia where all possible medical interventions were free and without risk, sure, I'd be all for either parent being able to terminate their financial responsibility. What you fail to see is that in any world where the absurdly advanced things you bring up would exist, economic resources as we understand them would be completely different. You can't use the reasoning from a utopia in the real world. So you are saying that you oppose giving male-bodied people a unilateral opt-out from paying child support due to the fact that, unlike female-bodied people, male-bodied people will not risk their lives either getting an abortion or giving birth, correct?   Sure, but it doesn't mean that it must be perfectly equal either. Perfectly equal? No. More equal? Possibly Yes.   Do you expect male bodied people to be legally mandated give up their organs to equalize maternal organ failure rates? No, because that would be a violation of their rights. However, I *do* support legally coerced body part donations for criminals.   How about entirely equal representation in intensely physical roles like firefighters? Wouldn't a more male-centered firefighting force be more effective, though? Of course, if there is some way to significantly increase women's strength, then I would certainly be in favor of it and in favor of making it available! :)   Collective sex/gender based punishment for crimes with a heavy correlation to sex and/or gender like rape and murder? What exactly are you thinking of here? Indeed, care to please elaborate on this part?   Are you willing to cause potential harm to yourself for this equality, or does it only extend to situations that would personally benefit you? Isn't surgical castration harm to myself, though? After all, as far as I know, just like pregnancy and childbirth, surgical castration carries a risk of death (and other negative side effects as well)! :( Plus, surgical castration necessitates a lifetime of hormone replacement therapy in order to avoid things such as osteoporosis. :(","No, because that would be a violation of their rights.

d6u4wvl,jillstein,"Also, while you are considering FPTP, consider Direct Democracy. I think that is a more sustainable objective (both are good). Democracy does have inherent problems no matter how fair the voting system is or how fairly the people are represented. A tyranny of the majority situation is possible. One pithy way of putting this would be, if democracy votes for you to jump off a bridge then it's wrong, period. But more likely the ""tyranny of the majority"" would manifest in the form of one single untailored policy for everyone. Tyranny of the majority is a problem especially with disadvantaged minorities (in a broad sense). If we had an ""exit, not votes"" system with free entry and exit into communities with compatible people, then perhaps these minorities wouldn't need so much activism to attempt to convince the majority to care about their issues. I wonder if you have seen this proposal of [atomic communitarianism]( (Not because I necessarily endorse what this says, but as an interesting proposal of an alternative to democratic systems).

d5tkymf,jillstein,"  The environment is a precious gift and needs to be protected.  Gov. Johnson believes strongly that the first responsibility of government is to protect citizens from those who would do them harm, whether it be a foreign aggressor, a criminal — or a bad actor who harms the environment upon which we all depend.  Consistent with that responsibility, Gary Johnson believes it is the proper role of government to enforce reasonable environmental protections. He did so as Governor, and would do so as President.  However, Gov. Johnson also believes that it is NOT the proper role of government to engage in social and economic engineering for the purpose of manipulating the energy marketplace or creating winners and losers in what should be a robust free market. Such efforts have failed in the past, and are doomed to continue to fail. Preventing a polluter from harming our water or air is one thing. Deciding in Washington, DC, that one source of energy should be subsidized and others penalized is a different matter. Here's where I'm betting you and other Stein fans will disagree (and that's fine - Johnson himself has said his government wouldn't be one that's ""his way or the highway"". He's very inclusive and open to finding different ways of doing things if there's a compelling reason to do so).  When it comes to global climate change, Gov. Johnson believes too many politicians are having the wrong debate. Is the climate changing? Probably so. Is man contributing to that change? Probably so. The important question, however, is whether the government’s efforts to regulate, tax and manipulate the marketplace in order to impact that change are cost-effective — or effective at all. Given the realities of global energy and resource use, there is little evidence that the burden being placed on Americans is making a difference that justifies the cost. Regarding private prisons, Gary is in favor of ending the drug war, which would lead to the release of millions of prisoners nationwide and put an end to the mass incarceration that has provided massive profits to private prison operators. I can assure you they do not want him in the White House! The current system is a prime example of crony capitalism which is something Johnson speaks out against vehemently.","Consistent with that responsibility, Gary Johnson believes it is the proper role of government to enforce reasonable environmental protections.

gokaqbw,LockdownSkepticism,"Christmas of 2021: According to both President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci, together the two most prominent voices on public health in America right now, that’s when we can hope for a return to normalcy, the beginning of life after the emergency. Even that not-exactly-optimistic prediction comes with hedges and caveats. Next Christmas won’t necessarily be the end of pandemic restrictions, according to Biden — just a time when “significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, having to wear a mask.” Likewise, Fauci has described his hope as “a degree of normality” by the end of 2021, with the possibility of widespread masking persisting into the following year. I am not vested with Biden’s authority or Fauci’s expertise, but I can read trend lines and vaccine studies, and at this moment both their takes look way too pessimistic. A major setback is always possible, but right now, the conditions for the end of the emergency seem likely to arrive sometime in the summer, not at Christmastime. Those conditions don’t require the coronavirus to disappear entirely. They just require its dangers to diminish to the point where the reasons for suspending ordinary life no longer obtain, and the emergency measures taken against Covid-19 no longer justify their cost. The looming arrival of herd immunity is part of this story. In a report over the weekend, two of my colleagues estimated that a combination of infections and vaccinations could deliver us into the herd-immunity range by July. If we speed up vaccination, the date might arrive even sooner. Alternatively, if social distancing declines rapidly in the interim or a more infectious variant spreads, then we’ll get a last spike of cases and more people will die — but more infections also means more immunity, so even in that grim scenario herd immunity could actually arrive sooner still. A variant that is more infectious and much more vaccine or immunity-resistant could alter this timeline. But the leading candidate for that role, the South African variant, appears at least somewhat vulnerable to the vaccines that we already have. And even in South Africa itself, it only appears to have caused a temporary spike in cases, followed by a swift decline. The other part of the optimistic story is vaccine availability. By sometime in the summer, if not sooner, everyone in the United States who wants a vaccine should be able to get one. This will create new challenges as public health authorities try to woo vaccine skeptics. But even if the uptake rate isn’t as high as it needs to be and it takes longer than hoped to fully clear the herd-immunity threshold, the simple availability of vaccines will change the moral calculus around the disease. What has been up till now a collective-action problem, justifying restrictions and closures and mask mandates, will become more of a matter of individual responsibility, where people who don’t get a vaccine are primarily putting themselves rather than society at risk. At that point, with herd immunity close and vaccines generally available, the arguments marshaled by Covid skeptics and lockdown critics, which have been mostly wrong or misguided up till now, will begin to make more sense. It’s not much worse than the flu, skeptics have argued. Well, no, Covid isn’t remotely like normal influenza. But under conditions of mass vaccination, with vaccines that reduce the risk of death and severe illness even among the small share of vaccinated people who get sick, the coronavirus will actually look a lot more like the flu. We can protect seniors and other vulnerable people while otherwise continuing with normal life, skeptics have argued. Well, no, we can’t, because the elderly and vulnerable are a huge population that can’t be easily segregated from the rest of society (and the segregation we’ve pursued has been quite cruel enough). But once you can vaccinate the elderly and others who are vulnerable, the disease can still circulate among younger and healthier people without it being a constant mass-fatality threat. The damage to the economy and mental health from closures and restrictions outweighs the threat of the disease itself, skeptics have insisted. Well, maybe in certain cases, like elementary school closures — but in general a disease that has killed at least 500,000 Americans more than justified a robust attempt to stop its spread. However: Once the old and vulnerable are genuinely protected, the death toll drops, and vaccines are generally available, the toll that emergency measures take on just about everyone — business owners, college kids, churches, parents, school-age children, the lonely and the old — really will become worse than whatever coronavirus threat remains. But because some threat will probably endure — perhaps through the winter, perhaps indefinitely — there may be pressure on anxious governments to keep the emergency measures in place or lift them ver-r-r-r-y slowly, and similar pressure on public health officials to overstate the continuing risks. For instance, the fact that a vaccine might not be approved for kids until 2022 could become a reason for schools to extend virtual learning for yet another semester — even though teachers can be vaccinated and the coronavirus does not appear to be more dangerous for children than the flu. Or again, the fear that a deadlier or vaccine-evading variant might come along could become a reason to maintain restrictions on restaurants, church services or private gatherings through the fall or winter — even though the possibility of a new variant could easily be with us every year, for decades, and we might as well start adapting now. Or the fear of long-haul, chronic-seeming Covid — which is a genuinely frightening part of this disease — could be cited as a reason restrictions need to remain in place until the virus is entirely eradicated. But other illnesses can have chronic consequences, too, and yet life continues around them: We don’t close schools for the Epstein-Barr virus, despite its link to chronic fatigue syndrome, or expect New England state parks to shut down all spring and summer because of the risk that Lyme disease turns chronic. To be clear, I can imagine scenarios for 2021’s fall or winter involving a particularly deadly variant or one that’s more dangerous to kids, where reimposing emergency measures might be necessary. And if we end up maintaining mask mandates a little longer than needed, and there’s more mask-wearing in the winter months and on public transportation going forward, then that’s hardly the greatest burden in the world. But the danger of the overcautious, wait-for-Christmas public rhetoric from Biden and Fauci is that it provides cover and encouragement for fearful officials to extend the whole suite of emergency measures for many unnecessary months.","But the leading candidate for that role, the South African variant, appears at least somewhat vulnerable to the vaccines that we already have.

j7ajt9s,LockdownSkepticism,"I think I come from an extreme situation that is pretty rare. My outlook is not good... From the Bay Area. Was a working actor in LA my adult life until lockdowns hit. I'm somewhere in my 30's. Nearly everyone I have ever known was pro lockdown, pro mask and pro vaccine mandate. I've been vocally against this since the beginning. I don't know one person who has changed their minds or shown any remorse. As a matter of fact I had two people two months ago come at me online. I posted a meme that mentioned several points. 1) You were denied organ transplants 2) You were fired from your job 3) You were banned from family events, etc...

A cousin who is a nurse, that had a wedding where vaccines and covid tests were required to attend, decided to chime in on my post that the vaccines are effective. I ripped her a new one pointing out reality and she buttoned it by saying ""Maybe we just shouldn't talk anymore"". I had already been ignoring her for two years. The other person was an actor who also claimed they were effective. That started a long emotional conversation where I revealed to him a lot of truths he had never even imagined...like actors having fake cards to avoid the shame. He used the ""We didn't know argument"" to explain the damage. To which I directed him to my social media where I had been posting things nearly three years ago that have turned out to be true. I do think I may have opened his eyes a little but I'm not expecting much and have walked away from the industry anyway. I'm seeing people in California avoiding talking about the damage.

il2vy9b,LockdownSkepticism,"Hi there, fellow Aspie! I understand those relational difficulties all too well. I'm kinda there with you on the physical stuff, too. I blew out my knee playing basketball 25 years ago (I'm 44yo). That blow out was the detachment of my ACL from my tibia. The surgery got me walking but it's prone to hyperextension and has arthritis already. No sports, hiking, etc for me. I also dealt with a nasty back issue over the past year. I was actually using crutches around my house and WFH a lot, hoping it would heal on its own. I finally tried a chiropractor who said it was basically scoliosis. The sideways, S-shaped curvature was about 3"" off, both directions, from the natural axis. We determined it was caused by a vomiting episode tearing an abdominal muscle combined with poor posture and my limping gait from my knee issue. It took about 6 months of 3-a-week chiro+PT sessions to get it *mostly* straightened out again. So, I kinda feel you on that, though my long-term issue is my unreliable, mileage-limiting knee which keeps me to about 4000 daily steps. Getting tired of edging into ""terminally-online"" territory (I have like 15,000 hours in WoW...), I bought a Toyota Tacoma in 2019 and some camping gear for ""overlanding"". Work's been too busy to do much of it but it has gotten my wife and me outdoors more. My back gave out (the issue detailed above) halfway through our stay in Rapid City, SD last summer after some 4-wheeling and time at Freedom Fest. But, we had a good time. ""Fortunately"" (?) I'm highly introverted so I'm okay not having routine social hobbies and end up playing a lot of videogames when I'm not working. The teamwork at work generally fulfills my surface social needs while hosting a ""men's breakfast"" every other week lets me keep up with the few friends I've gathered over the decades. If I had high social needs, I think life would feel a lot harder.   The fact that a lot of hobbies are out of bounds because so many hobbies that are used to be into are occupied by the hysterics and terminally online that drunk the propaganda endlessly. Yep. It's incredibly sad to see so many people being led around as such.   Also if you suggest moving, I simply do not have the money to move and its expensive. Moving is hard if you have a good support structure where you're at. But, I don't buy that it's expensive, tbh. If you're in a ""blue"" area, I bet your monthly costs are far higher than my son's here in Fort Wayne, Indiana. His rent is about $700/mo on the edge of the city. My mortgage is $615/mo, also on the edge of the city. Moving here from a ""stocked"" 2br apartment all the way over in Los Angeles (I just did 90210 in the calc) costs about $5k + miscellaneous stuff like driver's licensing, bank changes, etc. So, maybe $6k total + whatever rent/mortgage deposits/downpayments. For folks coming from high-rent areas, this ought not be a high hurdle unless you have very unique circumstances. Buying a car isn't all that terrible and, as long as your credit is okay, can cost as little as $400/mo for payment + insurance + licensure + maintenance if you're not too picky.   And yes I tried getting employment but every ""desperate"" employer i applied to isn't desperate enough despite my glowing IT skills while the same employer crying about a labor shortage IT has an oversupply of labor in most regions because it's the easy ""I'm gonna go into ____"" field for many people whose computer skills outstrip their interpersonal skills. I've found my success in factory-oriented, customized product layout CAD work. I've done so without a degree and with all of the relational prowess of the average Aspie. I pay my mortgage with about 3 days of my labor. Normal bills are paid after two weeks of labor. The rest is either paying for old debts, vehicle payments, etc. My wife's salary is all cheddar on top of that. I have a friend who has higher socialization needs and isn't married.

Of course, you end up doing less research as you go forward because you already have the main cases on common issues once you've done a few, so it's just checking for anything new or when a new or niche issue comes up, but you still get to write and tie it together for each case, which I like.

htq3sih,publicdefenders,"This is curious to me. A few questions: - Which borough? - Who initiated this? Is your PD trying to get off the case? - Where are you in the case? Is it set for trial? A year in on a misdemeanor is kind of strange. NY requires the prosecution to be ready for trial by 90 days after arraignment, so I'm assuming that you've passed that threshold, so you should be waiting for hearings or motions. In any case, it's a little late in the game to be making qualification (for PD services) an issue. I'm also kind of surprised because most of the offices in NYC aren't exactly scrupulous about screening for disqualifiers. From what little you've told us, including your desire to try this yourself, this sounds to me like someone wants off of your case because rubber is meeting the road and they're not seeing a non-trial path to resolution. I don't know what your criminal history looks like, but if you're like most people and don't have one so far, you definitely don't want to experiment with the criminal justice system, especially in NYC. It can be incredibly difficult for even experienced attorneys to navigate all of the weird minutiae of practice in NY, and that's just the statutes. There are scheduling orders, local practice rules, and rapidly developing areas of the law that are quite literally entirely different than they were even a couple years ago. The biggest problem with representing yourself, though, is that it makes discussing the case with anyone, either in court, or with the prosecutor, incredibly tricky. Your statements on the record can be used against you, and the prosecutor could very well record your calls. Sometimes you need that smokescreen that prevents the state from pinning down what *you* actually said. The jury won't hear that your attorney said, for example, that you had a good reason for doing something, but if the explanation comes directly from you (orally or in writing), that will probably be admitted against you. Also, to make matters worse, NY doesn't have an evidence code, so brushing up on the current state of the rules of evidence is a project all its own. It's all caselaw. I cannot imagine trying to do it without a Westlaw subscription. The NYCourts website has [a very helpful guide]( but there's some variation in the details, and it's always in flux. For example, [just *2 days ago*]( SCOTUS struck down NY's scheme for ""opening the door"" to testimony from unavailable witnesses. It's just a mess.","It's all caselaw.

hvcwh6w,publicdefenders,"It is really awesome that you're already eyeing the exciting world of public defense, but I'll also say that you're looking pretty far out as far as planning in that regard. For public defense offices (and really just about any legal job) they will not care one bit about where you went to undergrad. Frankly *most* public defense offices won't even really care about where you went to law school as long as it's a reasonably reputable school. What's going to end up mattering is what you do while you're in law school (are you doing things like mock trial, or a clinic, or interning at a public defense oriented office or organization). From my experience, the places that actually care where you went to law school are private firms and what not. What matters more is thinking about where you want to go to law school, how comfortable you are with going into debt, and your relatively confidence in your ability to do things like work *during* undergrad and law school to supplement your income and pay for some of school. Much like undergrad, different law schools can and will offer pretty varying amounts of aid. If you go in and get really solid grades and work hard to get a solid LSAT, there are law schools that could offer quite a bit of assistance (I got a full-ride offer to a very acceptable law school in my neck of the woods). The reality is that a lot of public defenders really struggle under massive loads of debt, it varies *significantly* by state, but if you're coming out with like 100k in student debt, it may take decades to pay that off on a PD salary, so you'll want to think hard about the risk involved. Honestly, if you know roughly where you want to practice, you might want to try and talk to an actual PD or two to ask them about all of this. In my experience, while they're usually busy humans, the legal community is pretty open in talking to prospective folks. Tldr: PD offices will not care in the slightest where you went to undergrad, the only advantage of a better undergrad is whether it will help you get into a better law school. The better decision is hard to answer here and is kind of just a personal judgment call.

e6bnjy0,SyrianRebels,"Well, the point is this: until this year, all the Assadist air defences were concentrated in two zones: Damascus and Homs. Yes, since late 2015, they moved some assets to Kweres. But mind: there were no Russian air defences there. Plus, the Israelis were never flying as much over Syria as this year. Finally, the USA and allies were flying over the parts of Syria were there were no Assadist air defences. So, the Russians came in, back in August 2015, kicked the SyAAF out of the Lattaka area (so much so, they even built a new helidrome for them at Sanobar) - and 'occupied a corner' of Syria where there was no 'conflict' between them and the SyAAF: even more so because their systems (radars etc.) can read the SyAAF's old Parol IFF. Overall, 'everything was fine' for more than the first two years. But, the IRGC then came to the idea to rile Israel, and thus: since February this year, all the possible sh... is flying around. The IRGC then did the logical thing: it checked where are the Russian air defences. The Russian air defences are deployed in the 'triangle' or 'semi-circle' connecting Lattakia with Tartus and Masyaf. 'OK', since even T-4 and Nayrab were hit by the Israelis, the IRGC thus re-deployed all of its important facilities 'behind' or right next to this area (especially to Masyaf) - as seen from Israel. 'Good idea' because now it's so that 'anybody' (read: Israelis) shooting at them appears as if 'shooting at the Russians'. The SyAAF is controlled by the Ba'ath Party, and this at least 'strongly influenced' by the Maher/Hossn + IRGC/Hezbollah conglomerate. What can it do but follow their orders - which were: move out and protect that area, because the Russians aren't going to do that for you nor for us. All of this is actually a direct product of the state of mind of Putin and his 'St Petersburger Club'. At least now they should have understood a few things: while it's perfectly likely (almost 'sure') they actually went to Syria with intention of 'making sure' that nobody would build an alternative gas-pipeline to the EU, they've got themselves into the bed with the IRGC. Now, the IRGC might not be super-smart: on the tactical level, they're perfectly incompetent. Alone the idea they could do everything with help of air defences only, is speaking volumes in this regards. But, if there is just one thing they know how to do, then that's about how to 'embed' themselves in a society as utterly ruined as that of Assadist Syria. And, they were, and remain - ready to invest more money into Syria than everybody else, **combined**. ...which translates into: at strategic level, when it comes to Syria, the IRGC is 'super smart'. In this case, they have - correctly - concluded that the best solution to avoid all of the Israeli air strikes, is to 'hug' the Russians. And since the Russians have deployed their air defences in that semi-circle/triangle from Lattakia via Tartous to Masyaf... well, what a better idea but to deploy their (Assadist and IRGC) facilities and defences 'behind' that 'shield', i.e. from Masyaf towards north. Anybody wanting to shot at them, MUST shoot 'at Russians'. Considering this, the VKS/RFA/V-MF SAM-crews were 'super-cool' during this Israeli attack. Forewarned by the Israelis or not: they did not open fire - although there were dozens of PGMs flying straight at their positions. That said, Putin, Konashenko etc. now have to decide: are their troops always going to be as cool, and as lucky (or not, in the case of the crew of that Il-20M) - or not? Then, thinking they could 'curb' the Israelis there... hahaha... that's as naive as thinking they could 'curb' the IRGC-QF/Hezbollah.

cxby8z5,TwoXChromosomes,"I'm sorry to hear that you went through this, OP. I made this account to share my story here, as it seems to be a supportive environment. I went to a friend's New Years party back in 2008/2009. I turned up with friends that I knew and met a group of people that I didn't know. Things started off pretty great. I was chatting to people and generally having a good time. A few hours into the party, I went to the kitchen to grab another drink and one of the girls who I had met that night followed me. She began (in the words of my friends) ""pouring shots down my throat"". Unbeknownst to me, someone had laced all the spirits at the party with something (I later heard cocaine but I have never actually had this confirmed). I woke up about 16 hours later, confused and in bed without much on, next to this girl. My friends had all left and I was terrified because I couldn't remember much. I was later told the evening had gone something like this - the girl proceeded to get me absolutely wasted, to the point that I couldn't walk or stand. Before I hit the point of not being able to stand, I apparently kissed her a bit. If the evening had ended that way, I wouldn't have minded. However, I lost interest in her, or stopped paying attention to her or something and started hanging with my friends again. She left for a bit, and was heard by some of my friends saying that if she wore her corset, then maybe then I would want to have sex with her. It was around this point that my best friend began to worry about me, as I couldn't stand, and took me up to a bed, where I passed out. Apparently, the girl came up a few hours later, woke me up and asked me for sex. I was in no state to make any decisions and don't remember this at all. She says that I wanted it and was consenting. But we ended up sleeping together and it was my first time. I have no memory of consenting, nor was I in a state to make that decision. I remember being a wreck the next day, not really able to process what had happened (partly due to having a massive 16 hour memory blank). I told my friends about it when we started back up at college (though they knew that we'd slept together already, evidently) and they sort of laughed it off. I joined in because I didn't know what else to do. I have been lucky in that some of them have been supportive since then and my current girlfriend was really supportive when I opened up to her about it. I have never spoken to my family about it, or gotten any help to talk about what happened professionally. Even typing this out has left me anxious and shaken. I hope that the OP can find a supportive group of people that will take this seriously. Because sexual assault is a serious matter, no matter who the victim, and it is a shame that assault against men is seen as some kind of a joke...","I told my friends about it when we started back up at college (though they knew that we'd slept together already, evidently) and they sort of laughed it off.

Not a good thing to say, but if they are focused on keeping people on economic doctrine and have to do something with the gays among the bourgeoisie, you can see where they come from. Now where we go from not unexpected from them to fucking vile and “you absolutely shouldn’t let that pass” is when they start saying things that can be interpreted as “people with certain traits such as ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexual preferences and/or their issues are counterrevolutionary”. That idea leads them to the worst things. This guy sounds that way. About religion-it is absolutely not trivial. Firstly, particularly religious socialism has quite a history. Secondly, some countries are just more religious than yours is, i personally would be surprised if people in some of those didn’t apply both generic socialism and the practices of their faith.

cg257jd,againstmensrights,"Hi there. Found any good subs? If you're still after cute animal content, I recommend /r/startledcats if you haven't found that one yet. I'm not interested in your gender, only mildly interested in glancing at your history to see what sort of stuff you're into, but definitely not interested in 'doxxing' your history (I think maybe you meant browsing - doxxing would be outing private info about you, I'm definitely not about to do that!). The reason this sub looks how you describe is because this sub exists for the express purpose of calling out /r/mensrights (and other places like A Voice for Men) on its various anti/woman, anti-feminist or otherwise hateful or just nonsensical content. It's not a 'primary' feminist sub as it were, there aren't *supposed* to be feminist articles or anything like that here. There are various other women's and feminist subs worrying about women's and feminist content, and I (and I imagine most others here) am an active participant in those as well. Those would be the subs that offer 'quality thought towards change', as you put it. Some of us also engage in debating with MRAs on /r/FeMRAdebates. The reason we're bothering to say OMGTHEYSAIDTHAT? is because we feel it's worth calling out when members of a ""human rights movement"" are trying to achieve their goal by being shitty to other human beings, or just ignoring the goal completely and focusing on their own personal biases. I personally believe in men's rights. I believe that men have issues which aren't being addressed, which need to be addressed, and I started off trying to get involved with that by participating in /r/mensrights. I ended up here because I have been consistently appalled by how much more time they would rather devote to attacking women and feminism than to actually addressing men's issues. I'm similar to [this guy]( except a bit more feminist. If it were some random little sub doing that, while a bunch of other men's subs tackled proper issues I wouldn't bother, but the fact that the primary men's rights forum has this attitude strikes me as a problem. It contrasts starkly with the primary feminist subs which are pretty much minding their own business and discussing women's issues. So, there's a bit of description of this sub and a bit of my opinion and reasons for participating here. I hope that answers you questions :)","It's not a 'primary' feminist sub as it were, there aren't *supposed* to be feminist articles or anything like that here.

ce1utye,againstmensrights,"That's the pattern we're seeing, isn't it. Feminists don't create, but they're certainly happy to move in and co-opt the fruits of successful creations. You know what this reminds me of? Jewish conspiracies. No, really. I used to love trolling right-wing nutjob websites (now I just mock them from afar on subreddits similar to this one), and once asked a group of racists, ""If white people are the master race, then how do the Jews control everything?"" Which, to me, still doesn't make sense. If white people made and invented all of civilization, how do a bunch of supposedly degenerate outsiders control the media, education system and government to successfully manipulate them? The response I got was to the effect of ""Jews are parasites who can't create anything, so they're apt at leeching off of the superior white man"". Which, again, made me ask, ""Okay, so they're parasites who rely on you. I get it, you think they're inferior. But that doesn't explain how you - their 'betters' - haven't stopped them yet."" The conversation quickly became circular. They would insist that left wing ideologies - from antiracism to feminism - were responsible for the power behind the Zionist conspiracy. How the master race could collectively fall for these conspiracies was never explained. At once, white people were the victim of an evil Zionist conspiracy, but superior to the Jews. It was the epitome of cognitive dissonance. This same paradox drives the manosphere. Simultaneously, women (especially feminists) are stupid, good-for-nothing, emotional, illogical morons (probably with *gender studies degrees ahahahahhaha*) and controlling the world's institutions. Men were the creators of civilization, but didn't have control of it. I think this superior-victim complex is a defining feature of any reactionary political movement. You see the same thing with regards to race. White people are the victims of 'reverse racism', yet somehow they're better than POC. The superior-victim complex (lol im using fancy terms n stuff) betrays the real psychological drive behind these political groups - resentment over the loss of power, privilege and control. They feel that they deserve to control the world, but when they realise they don't have the level of privilege that their group had 50 years ago, they become panicked and vicious. This is why I don't trust 'mens rights movements', or any other right wing political movement. They insist that they want 'equality' (which, along with Ode to Joy and 'freedom', is the most appropriated thing ever), but really want to return to the status quo when they had the power they feel that they deserve. This is why there's such a focus on 'back when the feminist movement was good/about votes'. It's about regaining the privilege that was taken from them and framing it as 'the nasty evil feminists controlling my life'.","They feel that they deserve to control the world, but when they realise they don't have the level of privilege that their group had 50 years ago, they become panicked and vicious.

The tech industry cannot do what they want and maintain security of our military and economic networks. Any backdoor that government would want and could access is one that criminals, terrorists, and hostile nation states could exploit as well. The tech industry told our government as much and the issue was dropped by the vast majority who actually matter in the decision making process. At this point we have a high level FBI agent and a justice department employee stirring shit up and they have as much right to free speech as anyone else. Doesn't mean its going to lead to anything. And its not like this is not a familiar road. This same stance has been tried with drugs, guns, alcohol, and most recently vaping. Some changes in commercial stance did occur in all of these examples but in all of them competitors grew up to supply what others decided to side with government on. And little is done about it because actually nanny stating 350 million people on all these things is fucking HARD. But the bottom line is that as long as this nation's highest laws are determined to be the constitution, our government has little choice but to observe them. Significant groups have let them know that a constitutional convention to try and challenge some things will start a civil war. Martial Law to try and enforce some of this bullshit would result in civil war. And the military fears that a widespread civil war would lead to America being invaded by the two powers of the world who could beachhead us on the East and West coasts and shit would go South quickly after that. So no, the EU has nothing to worry about. Worst case scenario here would be the government passes a statutory law that they try and enforce while exempting them and their diplomatic, government, and military encryption from. A federal judge rules that the statutory law violates constitutional law and is invalid. Which by the way, doesn't matter as SCOTUS as already ruled in several cases that we citizens have no obligation to observe any unconstitutional law no matter what our government says. And then said law would be invalid until and if SCOTUS decided to hear it and they could certainly dodge the ball by refusing to hear the case and letting the d=federal judges ruling stand as is. And if by some chance they DID decide to hear it and rule against it, literally all HELL would break loose in this nation and the EU better look out for itself and count America out until we resolve our internal problems because there will certainly be plenty to resolve.

When virtually all of the projections show a bad outcome the issue is dropped. While I have not seen game theory projections on this particular situation I have read up on a scenario pertaining to the security of our voting process and what I got out of it was we need both more and stronger encryption, not less secure and more restricted use of encryption.

Even then, it's up to them. You're not entitled to content at a subjective ""reasonable"" price and it certainly doesn't justify piracy because you don't agree with it. They can do what they want with the content they created and for jobs that create content to work they need to be protected.   There is an ""infringement problem"" because they massively overvalue their zero marginal cost product. No, there's an infringement problem because the path of least resistance is to just pirate it. But even in this day and age with Steam/Netflix, that make it as easy as possible. you'll still find people massively pirate everything. You have to look at digital content creation as a type of architecture. This architecture needs to be stable and reliable. If I make content, I need to know how much of it I can sell and for how much I need to sell if. I 90% of my users steal my content, what's the point? Why would I ever make something else? If this architecture is flimsy you get people applying their own protection, like DRM, higher price to compensate for the pirates, etc.   If this directive was ever negotiated, the negotiator must have been the worst ever. It seems we got absolutely nothing. For you maybe, because you sound like a pro-pirate. So, good! The more content creators are protected, the more wealth they generate, the more taxes they pay, the easier it is for people to make more content, the more creative and varied content we get.   I guess we dont need this directive then. It does nothing, right? It does if you'd have followed the points up until now. The sites that people are worried might get affected, their favorite places for memes like youtube, reddit, facebook, instagram, etc, are not going to see any real difference. These places are already self managing, and far more aggressive than they're already doing. The kind of sites these articles want to attack are, for example, temporary sites that are created solely to share illegal content. These can be shut down as fast as they popup, but there's no real way to pursue the people who do it right now.

g7zduma,europrivacy,"It's a good law, and yes, the protests did nothing as for what they complained about had been removed from the text. It was mostly powered by big tech which didn't like that they would have to: 1. Reimburse people who had their content removed unjustly. 2. Couldn't naively keep online content they _know_ was infringing, without getting a license. On top of that, the opposition used the text from 2016 which called for things like automatic content detection algorithms, which has long been removed. In fact, at the time of the protests the text explicitly said that the directive under no circumstances can be used by member states to justify automatic general monitoring systems. As for the link tax, that one might've been the most ridiculous. It was never in the text, and by the time of the protests the text had been amended so much that no possible interpretation could even get close to anything else than concluding a link tax is not a thing.

dldda90,europrivacy,"Expanding on the above link. We started this project to help raise literacy in information security within the journalistic profession and the journalism community. But the videos we've made are as informative and accessible to other constituencies too. The legal and medical professions, civil society and charity workers, activists, and anyone who has an interest in maintaining their privacy and understanding the risks of using information technology. In the last few years there has been increasing dialogue between journalists on the one hand, and hackers, security-oriented software developers, privacy activists and security researchers on the other. A series of well-attended events organised by the Centre for Investigative Journalism has produced a beneficial crossover between these two communities. Our project arises out of this crossover. Up until now, the resources for getting started learning infosec for journalists have mostly been 1) online textual manuals and 2) cryptoparty style events. These are excellent resources, but still have significant barriers to entry and are not as readily given to propagation on the internet in 2017. Our aim is to simplify the process of communicating the most basic of infosec knowledge, by creating freely accessible, easy to understand, shareable videos on a well-known platform. We see the videos being shared among colleagues and co-workers as a shorthand way of getting them to install and use a specific application - streamlining an otherwise laborious process of step-by-step guidance. The videos combine A) step-by-step screen recorded demonstrations of basic tasks, such as installation and use of software with B) simple, animated technical explanations of the basics of what the software does, the threats it addresses, how it works and what its limitations are. We want users to learn theory and practice together, in as accessible a way as possible, but without giving them a false sense of security or placing them in harm's way. Perhaps our videos will be useful to you in explaining to others some of the technical concepts involved in information security, or will come in handy in training sessions, or as distributable resources or teaching materials in a wider course of training. If so, by all means, use them. That is what they are for.","But the videos we've made are as informative and accessible to other constituencies too.

fw3whxx,europrivacy,"source \[on Durov openly collecting data\] Since you're not entering a client-side decryption key to access your data on new device, nor scanning an encryption key from existing device to access data stored on your other client, you know you're requesting that data from server. To quote their [FAQ](  *secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.* Therefore non-secret messages are being stored by the server.  #x200B;  if you compared to the CEO of FB that multiple time talked about privacy Durov sure talks about privacy. But he doesn't put his money where his mouth is. He isn't deploying the ubiquitous end-to-end encryption he needs to.  #x200B;  read about the Mueller and Roger Stone case [ states that the messages were obtained either * via cloud backups: (when you enable opt-in cloud backups WhatsApp explicitly states they are not protected by end-to-end encryption), or * by compromising the endpoint ""*I would start by looking at those things,” she says. “It’s beyond the scope of the capabilities of WhatsApp, it has to do with how the users at the endpoints are handling their information.”* (which no networked TCB can protect against, I would know because nobody's built endpoint secure messaging system before me). There isn't any evidence the E2EE is being broken. These bypasses are however a possibility and luckily Signal doesn't have insecure cloud backups like WA. As for endpoint security, that's a whole another beast.  #x200B;  they still can provide the relative FB account and messenger communication, friend etc.. Way way different. So they can provide metadata that allows linking to another app that doesn't offer end-to-end encryption and get access to the content on that. That's what I pointed out. If the second messenger application is weaker (be it FB Messenger or Telegram, that's not within WA's domain.)  #x200B;  if you dont believe me i dont see how a out-of-contex quote may help. No my point is you should give me something that proves your point that I can search in the article and find the context of to see that it holds under the greater scheme of things. That will ensure there's no out-of-context statements and that you know what you're quoting, otherwise it's like me throwing a book at you and saying read that one first. It's painful to have have any fruitful discussion when one has to read lengthy articles. I've had other people throw articles at me to read to see what sticks, I don't have time for that, and respectfully, I think you have a responsibility to back your arguments in a way that easily proves your point.  #x200B;  they have been requested by the UK to backdoor it and there was allegation they did Yeah it was just something they flashed as an idea and everyone kind of freaked out about it. As for the Australian encryption Bill, here's what Joshua Lund from Signal [said](  *Although we can’t include a backdoor in Signal, the Australian government could attempt to block the service or restrict access to the app itself.* And here's what WhatsApp CEO [said](  *The ‘backdoor’ access you are demanding for law enforcement would be a gift to criminals, hackers and repressive regimes, creating a way for them to enter our systems and leaving every person on our platforms more vulnerable to real-life harm. It is simply impossible to create such a backdoor for one purpose and not expect others to try and open it. People’s private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that weakened security. That is not something we are prepared to do.*  #x200B;  i agree (but also i double check and i had it enabled. not sure if it is because I did set the old one to contact only) The trouble here is people are forgetful. Even hard boiled cypherpunks. I'm not sure if I can fit to one hand the number of times I forgot to add security notifications for WhatsApp back in the day. Forget that and all fingerprint checks are meaningless. Thankfully now the app offers to enable the setting when scanning the fingerprint so I no longer forget. This made me change my stance and consider WA reasonably well implemented. So indeed, these can be solved with smart UX and persistent settings. It's a good thing Telegram remembers the phone number setting, but that data comes from the server so it would appear the server can push settings to Telegram clients (at least during new install). That's anything but good. Client-side encrypted database would solve this but that's not something Telegram's working on (unlike Signal).  #x200B;  source \[on telegram collecting more information\]? That's just the nature of the app. It's not using E2EE by default, therefore it collects the content of all conversations. You can't enable E2EE for group messages, therefore it collects more information about groups. You can't enable E2EE for Windows/Linux desktop clients, therefore it collects all of your desktop chat content too. WhatsApp doesn't collect any of that content and note that **if** they performed a MITM attacks against their users, that would be the class-action lawsuit of the millenia: 2.7 billion counts of felonies that is eavesdropping on the users against their knowledge.  #x200B;  and so for all the party involved, all it take is a shady update. As long as you know only private chat are safe AND you verify the keys (and those are both a big if, i agree), you are as good or better Telegram doesn't need to put out any shady update to spy on their users' messages, they already are collecting that. The spying starts when they change the server-side code to mine that data, and users will never know when that happens. Every group message and every desktop message is sent to the cloud without end-to-end encryption. If you enable secret chats they sure those messages aren't eavesdropped or sold, but those messages are not very useful because again a) they're not available for groups, b) they're not available for majority of desktop clients.  #x200B;  Please dont pick my affirmation out of context, of course they will be wrong. Sorry that wasn't my intention. I wanted to highlight the small issue that is Google receives data about Signal, but yeah, defaults do matter, it wasn't an argument against that.  #x200B;  yes, ONLY secure chat are secure, and plus the bigger the group, more probable is someone is a snitch. Indeed, which is why end-to-end encryption doesn't make sense for larger groups. But Telegram community seems to be under the impression that ""E2EE for any size groups does not matter because if you can't have it for groups with 200,000 members too, what's the point"". Well, I think you said it the best; ""the bigger the group..."" 1/2",People‚Äôs private messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of that weakened security.

The biggest issue out there are generics, though. Generics in the United States are held to very low standards. And when it comes to extended release medications, the standards are laughable. Extended release generic medications do not have to release in the same mechanism, nor do they even have to be bio equivalent. They can be on or off by 20% of the active ingredient. As for time wise; well, pharmaceutical companies go by blood serum levels, not by therapeutic value. So even though the therapeutic value of Adderall XR wears off in about 6-8 hours, Adderall is still found in the blood at high enough amounts around hour 12 that they can claim it “lasts for 12 hours.” Think about Vyvanse, has anyone really EVER had that medication last 14 hours?

gvsk9yk,ADHDers,"Long post warning. For 20 years my sleep was out of control and unregulated. I haven't slept properly at night since I was a kid. I can sleep fine if I go to bed in the early hours of the morning. It's not insomnia -- unless I'm trying to go to bed hours before I'm ""supposed"" to. I have spent 6-8 sleepless hours tossing and turning in the bed before, only to drift off peacefully when it's my normal time to sleep. I'd be unable to sleep till early morning, only to have to wake up a few hours later. I'd pass out for 14, 15 hours and sleep some days away. I'd stay up whole days, sometimes two days in a row. There was no consistency and no quality whatsoever to my sleep. I felt immense, huge guilt about these things -- it messed with so much of my life. Social things, family would get mad at me, I missed so many classes and appointments and obligations. I accumulated so many tardies in school I was essentially just scheduled for detention. Oh and of course people made me feel like I was a trash human choosing this. Everyone else was able to sleep normal. Why not me? It sucked. A lot. Seven or eight years ago -- I discovered I have Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. It has been years of struggle even discovering the disorder. I have been relatively successful with longer-term sleep schedule modifications for periods of only about a year since discovering DSPD. Waking up early for jobs, such as the ones I had to arrive at 9AM after an hour commute -- I'd still get sleep deprived, more and more with each passing day. There's only so long you can run at 5-6 hours through the week, with 12-14 hour weekend ""catchups"" (note: it doesn't actually catch you up). Currently I'm more stable and less wacky-tired than I have been in a very, very long time. For about a year! I have accepted that an early wake-up time is not feasible for me. So I structured my life so that I can sleep through the morning. It doesn't really cause problems unless I let my sleep get to my natural pattern. My natural sleep pattern is 7AM - 5PM. That's incompatible with life. On that kind of schedule I had trouble taking care of basic needs such as banking, doctors, haircuts, etc. I don't really like being on that schedule even through ""self-acceptance"" because it causes quite a lot of problems. At least when you are alive in the afternoon, you share *some* time with normal business hours. So right now I am working a remote job, three hours behind my time zone. My 12PM is their 9AM. It works very well for me. 4AM - 12PM isn't really my natural sleep schedule -- but it works a hell of a lot better than trying to stick to a schedule that gets me up before noon. In the past, I would try to fix my sleep schedule over a single day. That's not possible, it's doomed to failure. I don't know why I thought it could work like that but I tried that repeatedly. I was able to adjust much better with gradual motions. I stayed up later and later over the course of a few weeks, until I had completely knocked myself around and was sleeping somewhat normally (10PM - 6AM). Of course that only lasted a week, as it ever does, but it was a lot easier to adjust this way than trying to knock myself backwards. Backwards just doesn't seem to work for me. Melatonin helps keep me in a stable schedule. I haven't noticed ill affects from it. Additionally, about a year ago, I was prescribed metformin for PCOS/high blood sugar. I don't think metformin has a direct effect on sleep (if anything, the googles tells me it's a disturber of sleep). But I think it has helped get my hormones in general more under control. I know about two weeks after I started my prescription, I started in general feeling a lot better physically than I had in a very, very long time. I also started probiotics around the same time. Possibly one of those two, or a combination of both. Additionally, for me, it is important to keep a somewhat regular schedule. I do not pull all-nighters at all anymore. I try to get to bed at roughly the same time with bedtime reminders, etc. Exactly to the minute isn't important, but it is really, really important I'm not trying to swing wildly from 10PM to 5AM to 8AM to 10AM for my bedtimes. Having a name for the disorder helped immensely with negative feelings. I struggled for a long time with self-hatred and bad feelings around my inability to control my sleep. It never occurred to me that it could be something actually beyond my control. I know I will never be an early riser, seeing the morning just isn't for me. But I'm very OK with this. Accepting it and acknowledging it's not something I can fix, and it's something that I do not have to feel bad about, has been immensely relieving. I don't feel like a piece of trash anymore. It's not my fault. It has a name!","Additionally, for me, it is important to keep a somewhat regular schedule. I do not pull all-nighters at all anymore.

dnqwtu5,Vegetarianism,"I have been asked this question repeatedly by my coworkers, who cannot fathom a life without eating meat. I get what you are asking, but they are different things. Although different in concept and it isn't about ""liking"" what you eat, it is like asking someone who doesn't like tomatoes why they eat plums. They are both fruits in the definition that they have internal seeds (or pits), they have a similar texture when ripe, they both have skin, etc. Why would a person eat one and not the other? I am a vegetarian, but I am not a vegan. My reasons for being a vegetarian may be different from others, and it is important to acknowledge that there are many different, equally valid, reasons to go vegetarian. I am very into the idea of environmental consciousness and preservation. I like eating foods that can be composted as frequently as possible and producing meat is much harder for our environment than plants, so I cut the eaters of plants from my diet. While I believe that I am also helping the notion of cruelty towards animals in this effort, this is not my sole reason for being vegetarian. We eat cage free eggs in our household and get vitamin D from other sources. I am not saying that it cannot be done, but in a family of 3, preparing family friendly vegan foods is a challenge. I admire people that are able to do it with families. You can't really think about vegan and vegetarianism as being synonymous. They are two different diets chosen for different reasons and a lot of thought goes behind either decision. Although drinking milk and consuming dairy products may have an implied cost of the mother cow being repeatedly fertilized and her children being taken from her for other purposes, drinking milk with that implied potential cost isn't the same for me as eating the flesh of the child that was taken from her and killed, but for others that is different, and that's okay. When we go clothes shopping at a store like Kohls, we are attracted to bargains. A shirt that is normally $30 is marked down to $5, making us far more likely to make that purchase. When ee purchase this shirt, we may be aware that those clothes perhaps were produced overseas. In this example, those stores use slave and child labor. As a consumer, we aren't the ones forcing these people to work, we aren't making that decision but if we purchase this shirt, without knowing the origins, we may be supporting these practices. If you completely stop purchasing any product that is produced in this fashion, will it close these factories? No. Other people will still keep on buying these products. However, as a consumer, you do have the power to lower the impact of your own demand. It may not eliminate these places, but maybe they will produce and waste less. Every time you can't be sure where an article of clothing was produced, you may be contributing to these kinds of factories as part of an implied cost. If you know that a company is using these practices and you continue to purchase from them you are directly supporting these factories. As a consumer, if you have dairy products you should be knowledgeable about their conditions and where they come from and acknowledge these as implied costs. Purchasing less will drive demand down, but anything you can do to help will. Knowingly consuming veal is like purchasing from a factory that uses slave labor. You know the cost of your actions and you are driving demand negatively. This is a tricky topic and people will view it differently than I do, but that is ny opinion on why I am not vegan. I try to do my part and limit what I can. The important thing to remember is that whatever you are able to do will make a difference.","As a consumer, if you have dairy products you should be knowledgeable about their conditions and where they come from and acknowledge these as implied costs.

From a realist position, sometimes you have to hold off on one aim in order to achieve another, more immediate good. Feeding starving people is pretty darn important and if an effective method presented itself that included meat, and the people you are trying to feed already eat meat, then I believe the benefactor should work within the recipients' ethical system instead of imposing another one onto a vulnerable group.","I would not appreciate someone discounting my charitable deeds just because my moral starting point doesn't directly correlate with theirs.

caj0n8t,Vegetarianism,"Killing is not inherently wrong in your mind? Other omnivorous animals kill, bear kills salmon, wild boar kill rodents... and so on. Humans are not above animals, but no are they under. Killing for food is not immoral in nature. Why is it immoral for humans to kill?  Would you say the same if that were a human? Firstly, killing humans really is not absurd. Humans used to be part of the food chain, we fought ourselves out of it. Was it immoral for the tiger to eat humans? Now I know what you meant though, would I as a human kill a human (for food I presume). No, I would not. Aside from probably bad taste (joking), humans are conscious of themselves in their own ego, conscious of future, conscious of the impact of their others as well as the impact of their death, able to reason and argue about ethics as we are doing. This consciousness is what would prevent me from farming and killing a human: he would be aware of his status, he would even be able to reason with me why not to kill him. Animals are not aware of the farming (only that they are stuck in this small cage, and that food comes from this tube...), and not capable of reasoning, they are reactive. The react to situations according to what is good for them there and then. So performing something reactive to them is not immoral, because it's part of the rules of their game, so to speak. Us humans play a game with each other that has more rules. (I hope I am clear, it's not so obvious to explain, this I admit).  What if you were the animal who wanted to live out their days and not be dragged to a kill floor? I totally agree with you on this. I am sure that's what they would prefer. Also that salmon would rather not be killed by that bear. Death is a part of life though, it's a natural process: animals kill and eat other animals.  You don't have to explain to me ""range"" or small farms. I didn't mean to make it sound that I was explaining range animals. I just meant to explain what meat I didn't ditch (response to your previous comment)  I had the courage to step back and question my own actions, and this is where it led me; to the vegan lifestyle. Questioning is very good, I also find that we absolutely need to think about what is moral, what isn't and to revise our eating habits to make sure they correspond to our ethics. Not enough people do it (especially in the cities where you never ever see production animals, only prepacked meat in stores). And if you think no animal killing is the way to go, then I am happy you chose the vegan lifestyle. I don't think ""courageous"" would be the appropriate word in my mind though (no offense meant), more ""true to yourself"" as opposed to hypocrites who don't want to know where their meat comes from and could not tend to or kill an animal themselves yet buy factory farmed meat. Caring and realistic would also suit for you.  That last paragraph about exploitation: It's more symbiosis. We feed, provide shelter, provide veterinary care, provide stress-free environment (no need to look out for predator constantly). Animals live in the present, I believe we can give them a happy life. We end it shorter than it could have been, but they had it happy. I don't eat much meat for ethical reasons, but my ethics don't point to me that eating meat is inherently wrong.

dmn0z7g,Vegetarianism,"Eating Kosher or Halal is also the right thing to do according to religious scriptures as both prescribe also how animals should be treated prior to kosher or halal butcher. Animal welfare is part of halal and kosher concept. It's not that far of from others choosing a plant based diet. Hence more Jews and Muslims are becoming vegetarians because a lot of the food that is sold as halal or kosher isn't truly kosher or halal because the animals suffered before butchering. Did you know that according to Islamic halal laws an animal is not allowed to see another animal being butchered, can't see the blood of the other animal, etc. I've read the article and it's a personal biased opinion piece. Just because you and the author don't consider it equal to a guest eating kosher or halal doesn't mean it's like that for every vegetarian or vegan. Bias: ""Probably her initial feelings will be disgust and repulsion."" Bias: ""By sticking to their ethical commitment, vegetarians signal that there is something wrong with being a carnivore, thus prompting other people to consider the morality of their habit of eating meat and perhaps even persuading them that consuming meat is wrong."" Flexitarians are also abundant in my country (The Netherlands). 55 percent of the people in my country refrain from meat consumtion 3 days per week or even more. I don't know which country you're from and maybe that's why you believe that you should let go of your principles and ethics to promote vegetarianism among your people.

crv6xn6,Vegetarianism,"Thanks. I've been thinking things out and writing it down because sometimes I've felt stumped when trying to give a succinct explanation when someone asks me why I'm vegan. It just feels obvious over the years, and I forget for a moment what the exact reason is why I'm vegan. If everyone went vegan overnight I'm guessing the worst thing that might happen would be that the farmers and slaughterhouses would kill all the animals and get out of the business as soon as they could, in order to do something that makes money. Otherwise they'd be financially ruined. In that case it would still be better than if everyone didn't go vegan because that would be the last generation of farm animals ever killed. Realistically, I don't know what would happen. Maybe the government would assist and help bail them out because farmers are 2% of the population and that's economically disruptive. Also, with 9 billion animals suddenly free and not being looked after the government might decide they're a public health risk or a risk to other wildlife. So the government might have a mass kill-off. But if absolutely everyone in the country went vegan and truly cared about animals? Then all the voters and government officials, who are also vegans, would decide to support these billions of animals until they die naturally. Pigs, cows, and chickens would die within 8 years and 15 years for cows. And I guess they'd be neutered. I listened to a philosophy bites podcast with Jeff McMahan and he addressed the broader question. I wrote down the gist of what he said because it's a common question I've heard too. I put the link below.  Jeff: ... an important point to consider is that animals also enjoy their meals and have valuable experiences....you would be depriving the animal of all its future enjoyable experiences. think about the pleasure from a meal derived from animal slaughter compared to all of the best-tasting vegetarian dishes that someone can cook. it that sufficient to outweigh all the good that could have been in that animal's life, it seems to me like the animal wins out.  interviewer: lets face it this animal isnt going to get any meals unless it's ending up on my plate because typically an animal that we eat that has been reared specifically as food only came into existence because it was going to be eaten.  Jeff:normally we think that when we bring a sentient being into existence for purposes of your own that gives you moral responsibilities for that sentient being's well-being. when you decide to have a child for example you thereby acquire a range of responsibilities for that child's well-being. animals certainly matter a lot less than your child does but why should you think that the matter is fundamentally different in the case of an animal that you can just bring animals into existence and not have any responsibility for them. It's true that the lives of all these billions of animals would not exist in the first place unless the meat industry existed. So you'd be, it could be argued, depriving future unborn farm animals of any existence whatsoever if everyone went vegan, which is one argument people make. But the problem is they would never talk about humans like this and argue that it's ok to bring an entire sub-class of humans into existence using, for sake of argument, special brave new world kind of laboratories in order to enslave them for profit and enjoyment. I think you should ask those homesteaders if they would treat their free range pigs the same way they'd treat humans who were at a comparable mental level because of brain damage, downs syndrome, or young age. Pigs are around the same mental level as an 18 month baby I read. Well, that was a dogs vs 18 month olds, but pigs are supposed to be about as smart as dogs. No one agrees that it's a good idea to bring someone into this world for the sole purpose of abusing them. So that's why I think non-existence is better - non-existence is better than being brought into the world only for the purpose of being owned and killed by others. You would be preventing the evil of killing those farm animals who exist currently and you'd be preventing whatever mistreatment is in store for these billions and billions of animals that would exist in future decades and centuries. Because think about the best case scenario for what the success rate might be for humane treatment. Let's say 99.999% of all farm animals, in this idealized hypothetical world, are slaughtered humanely. That still leaves .001% of animals to suffer some horrible death or mistreatment. .001% of 9 billion animals per year is 90,000 animals. According to estimates, psychopaths are 1-3% of the population so 1-3% of factory workers have psychopathic personality disorder. So the rate of maltreatment and cruelty is almost certainly way higher than .001%, to name just one reason. And look at the horrible success rate of the death penalty. The death penalty is carried out in practically the most ideal conditions possible - it's public and videotaped, medically supervised, a team of people attending to the inmate, there's political pressure to make it go smoothly because it makes international headlines if it doesn't. And even in that case there's nowhere near a success rate of 99.999% and it's only done a few dozen times per year. The meat industry is the death penalty 9 billion times per year. So you have course of action A) where at least 90,000 animals suffer horribly every year or course of action B) where no animals are suffering like that. My opinion is that if you would do it to animals but you wouldn't do it to humans you have to stop and ask why. That applies to this question, about what would happen to all the farm animals and whether non-existence is better. Would you kill a person just because they are too unintelligent? No? Then why would you do that to an animal? It's all so absurd and cruelly arbitrary. No matter what the mental gulf is between person A and person B it's never true that person A ceases to matter and that extends to all beings with a developed nervous system and emotions, as pigs, cows, and chickens have.  Along these lines, the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, underwritten by world-renowned scientists, notes that available scientific data clearly show that all mammals, and some other animals, are fully conscious beings.  That's why it's wrong to use this argument against animals but view humans as immune from this argument, because it's not true that animals are undeserving of basic dignity just because they're unintelligent compared to humans. Humans will be unintelligent compared to AI in 100 years, according to Stephen Hawking, so what does that do to this argument? Can artificially intelligent machines farm tens of billions of humans all over the world, inflating our numbers by 100X, because it's less bad than non-existence? And normally people believe that if someone is in a completely powerless state or disabled or has mental retardation that should make you increase your level of protectiveness and caring not decrease it. but that's exactly what we do with animals. we decrease it. This is my favorite quote from this peter singer interview that i linked to. this is gonna be my succinct answer to people:  ""the point about speciesism is that we give less weight to the interests of beings who are not members of our species simply because they are not members of our species. not looking at their individual characteristics, not looking at their capacities, or what's good for them or what's bad for them. we just say ""they're not members of the species homo sapiens therefore we can use them for our purposes, for our ends. we don't have to treat them as if their ends mattered. whereas if we have a human being, no matter what the mental level of that human being ""that human being's life is sacred, that human being is an end in itself, we must respect the dignity of that human being"" and so on. that's speciesism, to just take the species in itself as determinative of moral status.""    ","In that case it would still be better than if everyone didn't go vegan because that would be the last generation of farm animals ever killed. Realistically, I don't know what would happen. Maybe the government would assist and help bail them out because farmers are 2% of the population and that's economically disruptive.",None,None
gg4jweu,Vegetarianism,"Beans are definitely not the only way to get protein :) I’m a very picky eater myself and if you look at my post history I was worried about this too in the beginning (but mostly because I don’t like vegetables that much). Other than beans I think that my favorite source of protein is lentils :) I substitute them for meat in the dishes I used to really love, like lasagna and bolognese. So you can try that too! Look up recipes with lentils and maybe you’ll like one. I was very skeptical of them at first too but I like the texture of them a lot and they’re also really filling. As for the vegetables I can’t eat them plain either. I usually swallow them like a pill when they’re in my food because I can’t stand the texture or smell of them. But I do like blending them into my food or chopping them into tiny pieces. And as you keep eating and trying you’ll get more and more use to them. Just like yesterday I had some soup and realized I had some frozen broccoli in the fridge and just added them in and I actually ate a piece and survived, even though a few months ago I wouldn’t even try to do that. The things that I eat weekly really alternate according to what I have at home. I eat a lot of tomato based things and that’s honestly what’s holding me up because tomatoes are really nutritious. I have a bunch of crushed tomato cans ready to use and with that I make pasta, chili, soups, sauces, quesadillas and etc. I also like mushrooms a lot (a year ago I hated them so much) and with those I use them in sauces (for example I made the red lasagna sauce with them +lentils), soups and of course my most favorite meal probably is mushroom risotto (granted not very nutritious but sooo good). Fried rice is also a very easy meal and you can add eggs to them for protein and any veggies you might like or would want to try to like. I honestly have more recommendations and can share my recipes with you so you can certainly ask me here or in a DM:)",I usually swallow them like a pill when they‚Äôre in my food because I can‚Äôt stand the texture or smell of them.

I do not condone the feeding of kittens as food to any animal, alive or dead. I'm sorry if it looked like I was defending the right to do it, I was merely stating that from an ethical point of view, feeding a snake kittens is on the same level as feeding it any other small animal such as a mouse, rat, or rabbit, as those are also used for food and some keep as pets. There are many alternatives to feeding a snake live animals. I am not sure if the kittens were given to the snake alive or not, but I remember the claws causing damage to the snakes insides because it scratched it. Even retracted claws can scratch, and a kittens claws are fine and razor sharp. I'm led to think that it is possible they were alive when given to the snake, but given to the snake not alive is also a strong possibility. I myself own two cats, have owned many others growing up. I wouldn't feed cats to a snake, or any other animal for that matter. I'm sorry if this caused any mental unrest, as that was not my intention. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

ccio9hz,postnationalist,"Immigrants don't pay taxes. Immigrants pay taxes, in the form of income, property, sales, and taxes at the federal and state level. As far as income tax payments go, sources vary in their accounts, but a range of studies find that immigrants pay between $90 and $140 billion a year in federal, state, and local taxes. Undocumented immigrants pay income taxes as well, as evidenced by the Social Security Administration's ""suspense file"" (taxes that cannot be matched to workers' names and social security numbers), which grew by $20 billion between 1990 and 1998. Immigrants come here to take welfare. Immigrants come to work and reunite with family members. Immigrant labor force participation is consistently higher than native-born, and immigrant workers make up a larger share of the U.S. labor force (12.4%) than they do the U.S. population (11.5%). Moreover, the ratio between immigrant use of public benefits and the amount of taxes they pay is consistently favorable to the U.S. In one estimate, immigrants earn about $240 billion a year, pay about $90 billion a year in taxes, and use about $5 billion in public benefits. In another cut of the data, immigrant tax payments total $20 to $30 billion more than the amount of government services they use. Immigrants send all their money back to their home countries. In addition to the consumer spending of immigrant households, immigrants and their businesses contribute $162 billion in tax revenue to U.S. federal, state, and local governments. While it is true that immigrants remit billions of dollars a year to their home countries, this is one of the most targeted and effective forms of direct foreign investment. Immigrants take jobs and opportunity away from Americans. The largest wave of immigration to the U.S. since the early 1900s coincided with our lowest national unemployment rate and fastest economic growth. Immigrant entrepreneurs create jobs for U.S. and foreign workers, and foreign-born students allow many U.S. graduate programs to keep their doors open. While there has been no comprehensive study done of immigrant-owned businesses, we have countless examples: in Silicon Valley, companies begun by Chinese and Indian immigrants generated more than $19.5 billion in sales and nearly 73,000 jobs in 2000. Immigrants are a drain on the U.S. economy. During the 1990s, half of all new workers were foreign-born, filling gaps left by native-born workers in both the high- and low-skill ends of the spectrum. Immigrants fill jobs in key sectors, start their own businesses, and contribute to a thriving economy. The net benefit of immigration to the U.S. is nearly $10 billion annually. As Alan Greenspan points out, 70% of immigrants arrive in prime working age. That means we haven't spent a penny on their education, yet they are transplanted into our workforce and will contribute $500 billion toward our social security system over the next 20 years. Immigrants don't want to learn English or become Americans. Within ten years of arrival, more than 75% of immigrants speak English well; moreover, demand for English classes at the adult level far exceeds supply. Greater than 33% of immigrants are naturalized citizens; given increased immigration in the 1990s, this figure will rise as more legal permanent residents become eligible for naturalization in the coming years. The number of immigrants naturalizing spiked sharply after two events: enactment of immigration and welfare reform laws in 1996, and the terrorist attacks in 2001. Today's immigrants are different than those of 100 years ago. The percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born now stands at 11.5%; in the early 20th century it was approximately 15%. Similar to accusations about today's immigrants, those of 100 years ago initially often settled in mono-ethnic neighborhoods, spoke their native languages, and built up newspapers and businesses that catered to their fellow émigrés. They also experienced the same types of discrimination that today's immigrants face, and integrated within American culture at a similar rate. If we view history objectively, we remember that every new wave of immigrants has been met with suspicion and doubt and yet, ultimately, every past wave of immigrants has been vindicated and saluted. (Source: Census Data:  Most immigrants cross the border illegally. Around 75% of today's immigrants have legal permanent (immigrant) visas; of the 25% that are undocumented, 40% overstayed temporary (non-immigrant) visas. (Source: Department of Homeland Security  Weak U.S. border enforcement has led to high undocumented immigration. From 1986 to 1998, the Border Patrol's budget increased six-fold and the number of agents stationed on our southwest border doubled to 8,500. The Border Patrol also toughened its enforcement strategy, heavily fortifying typical urban entry points and pushing migrants into dangerous desert areas, in hopes of deterring crossings. Instead, the undocumented immigrant population doubled in that timeframe, to 8 million-despite the legalization of nearly 3 million immigrants after the enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986. Insufficient legal avenues for immigrants to enter the U.S., compared with the number of jobs in need of workers, has significantly contributed to this current conundrum. The war on terrorism can be won through immigration restrictions. No security expert since September 11th, 2001 has said that restrictive immigration measures would have prevented the terrorist attacks-instead, the key is effective use of good intelligence. Most of the 9/11 hijackers were here on legal visas. Since 9/11, the myriad of measures targeting immigrants in the name of national security have netted no terrorism prosecutions. In fact, several of these measures could have the opposite effect and actually make us less safe, as targeted communities of immigrants are afraid to come forward with information.

Instead of the law of the jungle rule concept where its simply a fight of the fittest for the benefit of the fittest few who then gather up all that they can and then everybody works for them for a pittance in a pyramidal system where we have a few with excessive power and wealth and then everyone else.

Separation from the source is suffering as we seek selfish gratification as desire for the wants of the self that devolved from needs. Selflessness is the freedom of letting go of the constraints of self. By letting go, the freedom of connection is made. Ego is a cage though by deception it seems to be freedom.

Artificial, temporal, temporary things called nations creating walls and boundaries between us we must unite as one people in peace, with respect for human rights and human dignity.

We could build a paradise here overnight by simply redirecting abilities and resources from violence and conflict and redirect it to helping those who are in need, for education, research and development into areas that help not hurt, build, not destroy, unify not divide. The vast majority of present day conflicts are coaxed, artificially bred for profit, control and power. If we eliminate conflict, we open upon an vast reservoir of resources that can be steered towards positive pursuits as in r and d for diseases, exploration, education, etc This is not a utopian cloud, this is not goal, and this is a path nothing neither more nor less.

Economically we can merge the two bookends of our financial endeavors. We can merge socialism/capitalism into a system that does not punish the weak that creates the poor on one end and the rich on the other. A system that seems to reward those who strive yet not to the point of obesity, to the point of extreme wealth that becomes mere exploitation. A system where the weakest, neediest, and hungriest partake first and the strongest are the last. A proposition of a path leads us to one world nation with real equality between peoples spanning geographical areas disallowing our present form of ruler-ship by the wealthy, the so called developed, the mighty and backdoor, the elitism of ‘first-worlder’s’ behind the scenes corporate entities driven by their bottom line at the expense of the environment, human rights, social equality and social conscience.

cl08b0c,postnationalist,"The economics of the USA for the middle class suck, you know. No improvement in fifteen, twenty, even thirty years for many and this during times of massive immigration. This is something but not a major point; something you might think about though. The main thing I see is you are riding point for an oligarchy that will ride all over you in the end. See this [Scholar Behind Viral 'Oligarchy' Study Tells You What It Means]( for how real power works and who wields it. You are also seeing a good deal of this from a USA point of view, it seems. The USA does not lack variety, but the world is fast losing/has lost the variety offered by the traditional, Constitutional USA. Some of this is due to immigration as few immigrants understand deep American *political* values. Remove first, second, fourth amendment rights and most immigrants won't even know why it matters if they notice at all b/c the places they come from have even fewer rights. Asian immigrants, for example, tend to have authoritarian attitudes, etc. Here is something from Britain: [Rotherham: politics ‘imported from Pakistan’ fuelled sex abuse cover-up – MP]( *Britain* has more variety due to immigration, but not a good kind and the *world* loses the variety of traditional British culture if this sort of thing continues. Many other European countries have similar problems with non-European immigrants who do not share European values. Additionally, small European nations risk losing their cultures and lands to big capital and immigrants from within Europe and from elsewhere. If you only see the good in ""free movement"" you will fail to see the problems. Right now we have enormous freedom of movement already available to many people. You don't need to preach PN as an ideal to encourage even more, especially if you can't see the downside. Most people who want to move want to move from a poor to a rich place. Many of those rich places taught the rest of the world science and medicine and so now and for a few more generations, the rest of the world has an enormous population compared to historical levels. So if all those people or even 1/5 of them move to Europe, US, Japan, the peoples of those countries will lose their cultures and traditions. Yeah, it's not exactly homogenized, but the distinct variety of those very successful nations will be lost. Japan is trying to prevent this and I admire them for that. It will be tough for a generation or two, but world populations cannot continue to rise forever, so they are biting the bullet now and allowing their population to decline. Hope they succeed for the sake of their culture and for the sake of the world environment as they will set a good example for others. I am all for meeting different people and learning from them, but you also have to preserve what is good in the world. Having a dreamy one-world ideal may very well not end up as you expect. As populations and cultures are mixed, they are also divided. ""Divide and conquer."" Once divided, they will be easy to conquer by nastier and nastier oligarchies. The article I posted above shows this is already happening in the USA. The EU is similarly compromised in many ways.

csoqsi3,postnationalist,"Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists. Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the ""starry-eyed internationalists"" who urged disarmament and who longed for a ""world state"" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.","Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.

cl2p5i6,postnationalist,"You basically construe everything bad as being nationalism or due to nationalism, thus anti-nationalism must be good. No, not at all. However, tribalism, ethnic strife, and other forms of bigotry certainly are related to nationalism; that's basically what nationalism is, it's the sense that ""my tribe is better then your tribe, so my tribe should own this land"".  PN is happening now due to powerful international oligarchies, which almost by definition ignore the will or needs of the masses. I don't think that's true, either. In Europe, post nationalism is happening basically because after WWII Europeans decided they were sick of war and sick of nationalism, and decided to try to form a larger union to make sure that didn't happen again and also to improve the economy; and then it expanded as the cold war ended and eastern European countries that wanted the same thing joined as well. That doesn't have anything to do with elites or oligarchs. The UN, in fact, was itself formed for similar reasons, with a lofty goal of eliminating war, or at least preventing wars between great powers.  The US is ruled by an oligarchy. No, it's not. It's still a democracy, voters still get the final say. The influence of money on campaigns is concerning and something we need to work on, but at most, the big effect it has tend to be in trying to convince the voters who they should vote for, it doesn't replace the voters.  A PN world is an imaginary thing, thus it is an ideal state and wanting it is idealism. It's really not. The EU is already a post-nationalist world, for the most part. For that matter, the internet is to some extent a post-nationalist world, and the world economy has become mostly post-nationalist as well. The EU has faults and failings, but even with that, it's quite clearly preferable to the late 19th century history of hostile nation states in Europe constantly threatening each other with military force.  You pit that word or ideal (PN) against ""racism"" or ""xenophobia"" and thus it must be good. You really haven't yet given an argument for why post-nationalism is bad. I understand that you're afraid of un-democratic one world govnerment or something like that, but that really has nothing to do with nationalism or anti-nationalism, and it's just not a likely outcome in any case; no people in a major democracy are going to agree to live in a non-democratic system, and too much of the world is now democratic. Democracy has only been spreading over time, and I haven't seen any sign that that's going to stop; in fact, in nondemocratic countries even now, demands for democracy seem to just be getting louder.","PN is happening now due to powerful international oligarchies, which almost by definition ignore the will or needs of the masses.

cmimfcr,postnationalist,"I originally saw this posted in /r/hungary (I'm married to a Hungarian). Interestingly, Hungary seems to be actively trying to gain new, young Hungarians. From what I understand, they've significantly relaxed rules for obtaining citizenship through jus sanguinis. Also, in an otherwise fairly flat income tax system, they give very large tax breaks to families with three or more kids. While this isn't the opening of the borders that, as someone who believes in free migration for all, I would love to see, it's the other realistic solution solution to the low birth rate problem. Countries will adopt a pro-immigrant policy or a pro-natalist policy (or both), or they'll have an aging population placing more and more burden on the young and getting less and less for it. When I clicked ""other discussions"", I saw that our intrepid moderator had posted this to quite a few other subreddits and endured some downvotes for it. I decided to read the /r/conspiracy post, because there is occasionally some interesting stuff amongst the anti-semitism and general craziness. I'll copy/paste what I posted there. It's, hopefully, only slightly trolly. If the ""family values"" seems to make me right-wing in the US political context, please understand it's not the case. I have quite a lot of family and friends from the poorer parts of the world (which is most of the world), and just understand that things are a bit different in most of the world. Here's the text: ---------------------- This is a problem beyond just Europe. In traditional/sane societies, the family is important. Members of families have duties towards each other. One of those duties is for children to support their parents when they're too old to work. The opposite side of that duty is for adults to have children (and more than one), if able to do so, so that they are not a burden on their larger community in their old age. With the rise of social democratic capitalism, instead of children directly taking care of their parents, they pay money through taxes to arrange money transfers to their elders (through pension and social insurance payments) and pay money through taxes for other care for their parents (old age homes, housing, etc.) Unfortunately, we arrive at a free rider problem. Why should I bother with having enough children to support me in old age when I know that other people's children will cover whatever my children can't? The biological imperative to pass on genes seems weaker than the desire to avoid the hassle of having kids, and besides it's so expensive! Think of all the cool consumer goods one has to pass up to afford to raise kids! Not having enough kids is a rational behavior in this kind of society. You would need to be a fool, or some kind of religious zealot, or dangerously outside the mainstream of society to act any different. And, in result, you get situations like this. My hope is that immigrants who are not so far removed reality will remind folks in the rich countries about the family values that seem to be forgotten.","I originally saw this posted in /r/hungary (I'm married to a Hungarian).

Politicians know that the system does not work, I feel conservatives deep down probably know it does not work but they're too invested in it to change anything.

It absolutely does not work and I feel like conservatives know this but they have a lot to gain by conning people into believing that it does work. Some liberals genuinely believe capitalism can be reformed whereas others know capitalism does not work and yet they don't want an alternative. The average person has not been shown an alternative so you are right but I think the liberal lie of capitalism can be reformed is also pretty strong to people who find issues with its flaws. The way I see it is that liberalism and free market capitalism exist on one spectrum and at the furthest end of liberalism, you have regulated capitalism and social policies like housing etc but it's still liberalism in that sense. I think this is the furthest people would take their political thought in general. To them it's between that and free market capitalism. The question of socialism and communism is so out of the question to these people that they will never even consider it and they actually shoot down the idea, partly due to strong propaganda. That's why the conservatives are Democrats are really having a tug of war of capitalism. Socialism is not presented as a viable alternative because very few politicians are socialists and because socialism has undergone strong propaganda that the very idea of it is shot down despite it being the best economic system. Capitalism to the elite is their life and even if they know it does not work for everyone, they don't really care because it does work for them and it makes them rich at the expense of everyone else.","I think the average person has a different level of understanding though, I do agree with you though.

If we think about everything in the black and white terms of capitalism/full communism, we might stay ideologically pure, but we're probably not going to help people in the short-term. For example - this whole discussion would be like you accusing me of supporting the principle wage labour, just because I've tried to help workers at my local WalMart unionise. Helping people to unionise is a practical step that exists within the capitalist system. It doesn't mean that I support the system, just that I'm trying to do the best I can based on what's realistically possible in the here and now. You're acting like I prefaced my original comment with: this is my perfect view of the world and is just how I would like everything to be forever. I *obviously* didn't say (or even imply) that. I made it reasonably clear that I thought that this might be an achievable stepping stone on the way to greater progress (just like unionising at WalMart). I'm so tired of these micro civil wars that continually break out amongst the left - just because someone said something that wasn't 100% in-line with the highest ideological principles.","Helping people to unionise is a practical step that exists within the capitalist system.

cd250p0,WhiteRights,"In case you don't know the history, Watson wrote some articles expressing his outrage over the Jewish bribery campaign to exonerate Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager who murdered a little white girl. After Jews pressured the Governor of Georgia to commute Frank's death sentence, angered citizens stormed the prison and hanged him themselves. Jews realized they'd really bungled the whole ordeal, so they started up the Anti-Defamation League to ensure it never happened again. Now, almost a century later, the ADL is bringing it's power to bear on the Georgia Governor again, this time against the legacy of Senator Watson, an unabashed champion of white interests and enemy of Jewish crooks and swindlers. edit: to be clear, there's no evidence Frank's trial was unfair or motivated by antisemitism. Frank was a well-connected Cornell graduate with top flight defense attorneys and investigators. (And his chief counsel happened to have been law partners with the Governor.) The other prime suspect was a poor black man. Both men testified at considerable length but only the black was cross-examined. In fact, Frank's lawyers blatantly exploited racial stereotypes and prejudices towards blacks in attempting to pin the blame. The case was appealed all the way to the Georgia and US Supreme Courts and affirmed each time. Frank also had considerable support in the press, especially the New York Times. The State of Georgia reviewed the case in 1986 and again *refused to upset the verdict*. (Although it did bow to Jewish pressure and grant a formal pardon on account of the extra-judicial lynching depriving Frank of further legal challenges, if any were to be had.) Nevertheless, all books and media portrayals of Frank cast him as an innocent victim of ""hate"" and either twist or ignore the historic record. Viewed fairly, the evidence points to Frank being a morally degenerate murderer and sexual deviant.

dtrk5ip,runaway,"Just some insight from someone who follows this sub a lot and has only ever ran away once, solo, so take this with a grain of salt: Money: the more the better. Seen people save hundreds and thousands for this on here. It can be advantageous to be in a group too so you can pool it together. But finding good people can be a task itself. Places to stay: Anyone's place you can crash at? Best friends, relatives, trustworthy people, people you actually know? They may be able to help out a lot in terms of shower and kitchen. I stayed at an abandoned site close to home. Pros: - It was free - It was quiet Cons: - I was breaking the law: Tresspassing on private property. If police find you, it's bad news. Speaking from experience. - Its dirty and gravely dangerous - Its a prime site for drug dealers, drug users, gangsters, rapists etc. Not worth it. Find a friend. Food: Nothing that smells bad or is gross. It will make it harder to make friends. Also, don't keep it all in one place. If a someone steals your food, you can at least have what you hid elsewhere.

i201yq6,runaway,"Sounds like a tough spot you're in, I'm sorry. However the fact that your case is still open is a good opportunity to change things for the better. Having a social worker to talk to is very valuable. You should definitely talk to them more and see if you can get them to give you more help. The fact that you're documenting the abuse is also very good, keep doing that, that will help support your case massively. However I do have to point out that getting a job and running away will not work. When you run away, you'll get caught very fast if you're turning up for work everyday. Besides, your a minor, so you don't have access to your own bank account, which means that your parents can see all the money that goes in and out of it. So figuring out where you work will be very easy. Unless you are getting some dodgy under-the-table cash only job, then your going to get caught within just a day or two most likely. Thats not to say pursuing a job is a bad idea, quite the opposite, it's great to have your own income.

gh6xrs3,runaway,"Wow, I feel heartbroken for you. You are not a bad person and 17 doesn't make you an adult that is capable of an adult perspective. You and your parents are asking too much of a 17-year-old girl. Most adults cannot handle the responsibility of an autistic child. Your parents are frustrated and have displaced anger. (taking out your anger and frustration on someone other than the person you are angry at) They would feel like bad people to take too much anger out on your disabled brother so it overflows to you. They are frustrated with his tantrums so anytime he fits off and you are available to blame the anger comes out on you. The truth is they simply don't know what is setting him off and what they can do about it. When your mom says you will put him in an asylum that is her fears and frustrations about what will happen to him when she is gone. The truth is you have no responsibility for him and the fact that at 17 you are not able to make a decision internally about what you might do is absolutely normal. It would be naive of her and you to think at this tender age you would. Most likely you won't really know until is required. Your mom in the same circumstances without the experience of having a child with autism may not have stepped up to the plate for a brother either if he had autism. She has no idea what it is like to have an autistic brother. It doesn't make you a bad person. You have a right to enjoy your life and not feel guilty. It is hard for your parents and they may or may not recognize the effect they are having on your self-confidence and identity. None of it is intentional they are just way overwhelmed. The fact that they seem to only like you when your brother is not around is confirmation of their true feelings for you. That is the only time they are capable of enjoying you because of the stress of your brother which is not his fault but the truth none-the-less. Cherish those times with your parents alone. That is who your parents truly are even if they are only able to share a glimpse of it. It truly is a very difficult situation. Running away is not a great option. A better option is finding a great support system for special needs siblings, counseling if possible. If it is not an option through your parents ask your school counselor. They must keep everything confidential. They often can provide counseling support at school. Look online for support groups for families and make some calls. Often they are volunteers that can point you in the right direction. You have made it this far. Hang in there, you don't have far to go. I do suggest you go away to college or whatever you decide to do at least for a few years. It is then you will be able to blossom and grown and find who you are apart from your family. But rest assured, your feelings and frustration with your brother absolutely does not make you a bad person. You don't have to be perfect to be good. You don't have to be a martyr to be good. It certainly doesn't in any way make you a bad person that you have feelings of frustration and anger with a disabled sibling. It is so normal and a support team and therapist would help you see that. I am the parent of an autistic daughter and yes, it is difficult for the family and her siblings. She has a twin brother and we separated their schools so he would not be so embarrassed by her fits and the school always talking about her behavior. The disabled child's needs and challenges can take over the whole family at times and it robs the siblings of a carefree childhood. Your parents deep down want to give your that but it is not possible and still care for your brother. You have one year left.

Some say at this point the only way to right it is to have the federal government step in - which it could. However, when this was first being considered under the Trump BOR that was a terrifing thought. There was no way the people were going to get water - it would all end up with big ag and business.

You can't make it not happen, you can only make it do less damage. Concentration is one of the ""do less damage"" options. We take all of the bad stuff and put it all somewhere where together. The problem is that there is a LOT of water and no storage. Japan is a small, densely populated country. There isn't a safe place to store that much water away from people. Even then, Japan is prone to earthquakes that might rupture any storage and risk exposure anyway. Dilution is the last option and the one they have chosen. We know that the effects of radiation get worse with more exposure, so how do we reduce exposure? We spread it out over the widest area so nothing is exposed to a dangerous level. For a cruder comparison... It's like farting in the car With friends. You can keep other drivers from smelling it by keeping the windows closed, but your friends are going to be mad. Or you can open the window. Technically you're exposing people outside the car to your fart, but in such small amounts they'll never know.","You can't make it not happen, you can only make it do less damage.

epxitd5,water,"Himalayan rock salt will not balance the pH. It's a neutral salt. Same as table salt. The color comes from impurities in the ground.

Yeah as long as you keep up on your leafy greens, the Ca/Mg from water aren't as important. Distilled water is soft and won't have chlorine, so to you it probably tastes better than the tap water. However, distillation does not remove volatile organic contamination, so if that's a concern, you need another strategy. It does remove heavy metals, so if you live in a house with lead piping, there's that...however there are less energy intensive ways to remove VOC/chlorine/heavy metals as well. As for drinking the distilled water exclusively....as a student in undergrad, we were told STERNLY not to drink the deionized water (same purity level as distilled) because consuming a lot of it could cause an isotonic condition in your body leading to brain swelling and other issues. A guy first hand experienced it, started getting severe headaches from taking home jugs of the deionized water to drink at home in spite of the warnings. So...idk. Try not to drink too much, and make sure you're getting plenty of electrolytes too. There's a reason many RO systems come with re-mineralizers - both the taste and safety is better.

kd3govy,water,"Firstly, this test does not include chlorine which is typical in a lot of tests. If this is city water you may want to test separately for that. If this is a well water test you may still want to test for it in certain circumstances. Do not confuse Chlorine as Cl2 gas or Sodium Hypochlorite or Calcium Hypochlorite used as disinfectants in water supply with Chloride (negatively charged chlorine atoms introduced by dissolved salts). Activated Carbon and letting drinking water sit in an open pitcher in the fridge are good ways to get rid of chlorine based disinfectants. Now to the test: This is a very clean test with the exception of your Zinc levels which are quite high and your borderline limit on acidity which might be the cause of your high zinc. If your house has any galvanized plumbing the acidity of your water may be causing these levels. You can address acidity with neutralizing filters which are a pain because they need to back flushed or frequently changed and they increase water hardness. So the first thing to check is if you have any galvanized plumbing lurking in your chain of supply. Reverse Osmosis and ionizing filters are the best way to reduce Zinc but both represent significant investment on a whole house basis so look for sources of zinc before taking that dive given the otherwise low levels of contamination under your current test. Generally speaking an upper limit of 40 mg per day is recommended for adults with levels of 150-400 causing issues with copper and iron balance and levels above that leading to gastrointestinal issues. At consumption of say 4 liters per day these levels are high. Regarding the rest: BLQ (LOQ-0.1) means “Below limit of quantification at limit of quantification of 0.1 mg/liter”. In other words anything labeled with that means nothing above the limit could be detected. Your chloride as CL levels at 15.6 are consistent with clean river water or well water with low salt content. Your Total Hardness (as CaCO3) and Calcium hardness are both near the top range of “soft” just below the barrier to “moderate or medium” hardness. Please ask questions if this is confusing or you need clarification.",Activated Carbon and letting drinking water sit in an open pitcher in the fridge are good ways to get rid of chlorine based disinfectants.

cylxmsx,water,"Chicago turned its back on the Chicago River for most of its history. We are, of course famous for having reversed the flow of the river in 1900 so as to take our sewage down the Mississippi rather than let it flow into Lake Michigan, the source of our drinking water. So for most of our history, the river was written off and you can see that reflected in most of the architecture that lines the river. Solid walls where one might otherwise expect terraces. A lot of effort has been made over the years to reduce the amount of waste that flows into the river. We've been digging a Deep Tunnel system to hold excess water and sewage for something like 20 years or more. It's only as recent as 2011 that the Federal government started pressuring the city to do more and anecdotal evidence suggest the river is slowly coming back to life, even though the kayakers who ply the river are careful to rinse their mouths out if any river water gets in there. Riverfront property is now on the rise in value, so the signs are good. One side story is worth noting just for its curiosity value. Chicago is riddled with a small tunnel system dug in the 1900's. The idea was to have an underground railroad move cargo under the streets. The venture went bust, but the tunnels remain and are used by everybody who needs to lay cable downtown. In 1992, while driving a wooden piling into the river, workers punctured the tunnel and the river started to drain into the tunnels, which caused the basements of many buildings to flood and creating much damage. But it was basically an invisible flood. The city tried to stop the draining by throwing mattresses into the vortex. It was indeed a comical sight. Eventually the hole was plugged and that portion of the tunnel under the river was sealed off. But it's impossible to forget the scene of city workers throwing beds into the river!","The venture went bust, but the tunnels remain and are used by everybody who needs to lay cable downtown.

incfuav,water,"Property tax.  Capital gains tax.  Vehicle tax. None of these are a tax on the USE of my property though. I pay the same property tax whether I use my house or not. I pay the same vehicle tax no matter how many miles I put on my vehicle. In fact, water is already subject to capital gains taxes and property taxes (irrigated farmland is assessed higher). None of these taxes incentivize less use of the asset and in fact incentivize maximum use of the asset in many cases. So again, I don't see any precedent for taxing someone's asset based on how much they use it.  raise enough money to pay current fair market value for everyone’s water shares I'm not sure you have any idea of exactly how much money this would be. Take one system in Colorado, the Colorado-Big Thompson project. There are 310,000 shares and the current price is about $70,000 per share. That's $21.7 BILLION to buy out this *one* system in *one* state. And there are many systems in many states.  eminent domain Extraordinarily unpopular to the point of being political suicide for anyone that merely suggests it. And keep in mind that if we're nationalizing water, cities who have spent a lot of time, effort, and money to build robust water portfolios will lose their water as well. I can't imagine much support in rural or urban areas.  Focusing on short term and small quality [sic] leases is like focusing on 10% of the problem. No, this is critical. First, you've ignored my main point which was about the importance of creating more efficient water markets. An efficient water market allows water to seek high-value uses. An efficient market allows quick responses to rapid changes in supply and/or demand. Changes which are common but most current markets are slow to respond to. As you've pointed out, ag's slice of the pie is about 80%. That means that even very small (percentage-wise) contributions from ag can make a huge (percentage-wise) impact for municipal users. And short-term small-scale leases have the potential to minimally impact ag users while really adding up for municipalities. Here's a decision that I just made a couple of weeks ago. I had about 2 acre feet left in my account. My crop had reached maturity so it didn't *need* the water, but irrigating would boost my yield by a small percentage. Do I use the water or not? Well, any leftover water in my account doesn't roll over to next year, so doing nothing with it gets me nothing. Putting it on one of my fields will get me more than nothing. So I use it. But if what if there was a third option, which is to lease the balance to a nearby city in exchange for cash? With an efficient and transparent market, I could pull up my phone and see what the going rate is per acre foot, quickly do the math on how many extra bales of hay that water would produce for me, and decide if it's more profitable for me to use it or to send it to the city. If water's scarce and rates are high, I'll probably lease it out. If water's plentiful and rates are low, I'll probably make more by using it. This is exactly what you, I, municipal users and ag users want to incentivize. Those two acre feet would supply six to eight households for a year. And I'm just a small farm with very little water, so these numbers would be huge when spread across major ag users. Plus, if all of a sudden I can get cash for leftover water, maybe I start investing in efficiency improvements because I'll see the ROI. Is what I'm proposing a silver bullet? No, but this is where I see the most room for rapid improvement with minimal investment and high public support. I can see that this is a subject that you're interested in and passionate about. I commend you for that because it really is fascinating and most folks don't care about water issues until their taps don't turn on. But your ideas demonstrate a very rudimentary understanding of how things work. I highly recommend learning as much as possible before thinking you have it all figured out.","And keep in mind that if we're nationalizing water, cities who have spent a lot of time, effort, and money to build robust water portfolios will lose their water as well.

ik2yzss,water,"Last year we saw ZeroWater tested against tap water in Phoenix, AZ and saw that it did indeed First of all, for you to have deficient calcium or magnesium you would have to have some chronic disease or use some medication chronically. The homeostasis of calcium and magnesium is complex. If you have a calcium deficit you either have a parathyroid problem or chronic kidney disease. High magnesium can also cause your parathyroid and kidney to not work properly, resulting in low calcium. Minerals in your drinks are only important if you're doing some extensive activity and consuming lots of water, but salt is the more important mineral. If you're dehydrated and consume a lot of water with no solutes your body's osmolarity will be very diluted and it's going to compensate for that by dumping salt and water will follow the salt which makes your condition even worst. Another rare condition that can cause low magnesium levels is the chronic use of Proton Pump Inhibitors for GERD or if you have some sort of bowel disease that can cause you to have an absorption problem like chrons disease or ulcerative colitis...but magnesium and calcium are the least of your worry if you have these disease.","If you have a calcium deficit you either have a parathyroid problem or chronic kidney disease.

I’ve been told that this water is virtually untouchable due to the very high level of bacteria. I don’t believe it is connected to ground water in any way, I think it is semi sealed and it just pulls in any water which drains from the field which surrounds it.

I was told that I could put a small amount of chlorine which will kill off the bacteria, but I thought that (a) chlorine needs sunshine to work, and the water doesn’t get any sunshine and (b) chlorine will kill off plants and trees if too much is used (and putting too little will have negligible effect) 2) if I just dump this water and let it fill up again, do you think I’ll still have the same problem?

Seattle municipal drinking water originates in protected watersheds and meets USEPA drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 as amended several times, signed by President Gerald Ford. Of course, some households might have connections that contaminate waters, which is why there is a residual amount of harmless chlorine required to kill microorganisms. If your chlorine bothers you, you can aerate the water or leave water containers open so the residual dissipates. If your tap water picks up color, odor, or sediment, you can install an inexpensive activated carbon filter on your drinking water faucets or use a filter for water jugs. These are inexpensive, safe and log-lasting. I don't know why you would install a reverse osmosis system unless a physician is treating you for some malady that requires desalinated water.
