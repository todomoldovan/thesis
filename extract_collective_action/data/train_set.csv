Can't do birthday surprises because she has to remind me her birthday is coming up (which she does, cause she's an awesome partner and understands that I struggle with stuff like this, even though I DO care!) so we can plan it out.

Everyone else is simply subjected to it and has a right to fight for a better economic system and a better life.

You told me to make all these differences without taking into account how not everyone have the means to do what you did, doesnt mean that we’re not doing anything. Lets stop talking about change for a moment and talk about how you view human emotions in all of this, are we not allowed to be sad, hurt? Lets compare this to school shooting, more severe than animal cruelty in aspects but an act of cruelty nonetheless - that could be easily prevented or reduced with gun laws, are people not allowed to feel sad about school shootings even though it happens again and again and again?

k3q2jyl,water,"Want to add my thoughts in here as well. Purchased about a month ago. 1. Flow rate is about .38 GPM (there's a secret menu where it shows this) 2. Water temp on cold can get to 32deg F (same secret menu shows this) 3. The internal solenoid valve can shake the plastic tubing, especially on ambient. Not annoying, but it happens. Was told that I should install a water hammer arrester inline. I also plan on converting the tubing over to copper/brass, which should also significantly eliminate issues. 4. Sparkling water is strong. Like another poster said - the canister is the same as the orig soda stream one (ie the threaded cap). The canisters from Kul are basically the same price as any others. Buy those. Also, since they do use the threaded cap, invest in a 5gal tank and refill on your own. It used to be a bit more costly to fill up the new quick disconnect canisters (adapter was more expensive). 5. I dont use the hot water feature. We have a coffee machine that does the same. 6. Power usage - I wasnt able to find this on the site, so I did my own testing. I actually keep this machine on sleep mode for 18 hours (12p to 6a). Power usage is MINIMAL. I'll pull the stats off my Kill-a-Watt later, but I was surprised. At most it uses around 100W. Again, this is no hot water. I was also told by support that if you want hot water, just flip the switch and wait 2 min. The heater is what is the most expensive in terms of power usage. 7. The water itself - actually tastes clean. Happy here. 8. Someone asked about filters. I've removed the water filter. It's really easy, just like a fridge. Looking at the usage - our house of 4 will allow this filter to last a year. I went ahead and bought another one to keep on hand. For the CO2 canister - again, very easy. Just twist. 9. Noise - the compressor will make noise. That's a given. The fan will as well. I checked the fan - it's a 90mm 24v computer style fan. Unfortunately Noctua doesnt make a compatible one, otherwise, I would have replaced it immediately. The fan they chose is as quiet as they come right now given the requirements. Overall - being honest here. It's a luxury purchase. You would buy this machine if you want sparkling water on demand, and you want to eliminate an appliance. My only concern on this machine - there are no known aftermarket water filters. What I should do is examine the existing filter and check others for compatibility. I'm betting Kul didnt reinvent the wheel here.",7. The water itself - actually tastes clean. Happy here.,None,None,None
jcu4v3r,runaway,"In July I came across the Free to Play Walk to Earn/Battle NFT web3 phone app called Walken ([Walken.io]( At first, I was skeptical and played for free, I slowly started to add a little money and reinvested some of my winnings back into the game and now earn about $15-$20 a day opening my app 3 times a day to ""battle"" for a few minutes. In Walken the app uses Cathletes (NFTS) to battle other Cathletes to earn the in-game currency Walken. Walken is built on the Solana blockchain, which you can use as currency as well. You can level up your Cathletes to add to their base stats, the higher the level, the higher the reward you can earn in competition. The Cathletes can be dressed in clothes to help add to your base stats to make the strongest Cathlete, you can also accumulate "" Mysberries"" for losses, wheel spins, daily quest, or you can purchase at the marketplace. Mysberries help raise your base stats for ALL of your Cathletes. The app has an extremely active marketplace where you can buy or sell Cathletes, as well as items. The Walken team has been extremely ambitious with their roadmap, adding all different types of mechanics and ways to earn Walken. The past couple months they have added free daily spins on a prize wheel, staking, easy-hard daily challenges, and more to come. The team is very active on twitter, discord, telegram, and the support team is fantastic. The community is extremely active with users based all over the world and over 2 million registered users. I have found this game to be alot of fun and an easy source of side income, I already recovered my ROI and only took about 4 months. If you are interested in playing immediately and want to get an early start, you can immediately earn **10 Gems + 5 Walken + 100 Mysberries** using my referral code: **AOJFMFA**","The past couple months they have added free daily spins on a prize wheel, staking, easy-hard daily challenges, and more to come.

cu7ye54,FeMRADebates,"According to the Pennsylvania Child Welfare Resource Center, adult perpetrators are responsible for two-thirds of CSA cases. Among them, up to 90 percent are male.   On average, approximately 6,500 sexual offences were reported to the Queensland Police Service annually between the years of 1996 and 1998. The majority of reported offences were committed against children younger than 16 years of age (58%). Most of the offenders were male (71%) and most were known to their victim in some way (60%); many were identified as relatives (26%). (Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, 1999)  * Offenders are overwhelmingly male, ranging from adolescents to the elderly (page 171).  * Some perpetrators are female. It is estimated that women are the abusers in about 14% of cases reported among boys and 6% of cases reported among girls.   Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by males (ABS, 2005; McCloskey   Raphael, 2005; Peter, 2009). ...   Although males clearly constitute the majority of perpetrators, a review of the evidence for female sex abusers (McCloskey   Raphael, 2005), suggested that females do abuse in a small proportion of cases. Data from the US National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) showed that males made up 90% of adult child sexual assault perpetrators, while 3.9% of perpetrators were female, with a further 6% classified as “unknown gender” (McCloskey   Raphael, 2005). Admittedly they follow with:   In a study comparing male and female perpetrated child sexual abuse using data from the 1998 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (Peter, 2009), 10.7% of child sexual abuse incidents were found to be perpetrated by females. McCloskey and Raphael (2005) argued that female perpetrators of child sexual abuse could be much higher as many cases go under-reported. However, this is speculation and ""much higher"" than 10.7% is still potentially much less than 50%. I am sure that many cases go unreported and I don't have trouble believing that cases with female perpetrators are less likely to be reported and successfully prosecuted that those with male perpetrators. However, I have not seen anything which would make me believe that the actual rates of offending are close to 50-50. I've looked for the evidence against this.

It’s completely possible he is dyslexic but dyslexia is such a massive spectrum it’s hard to tell if it’s dyslexia or another issue. Sadly dyslexia isn’t easy to diagnose at the best of times. It’s particularly hard in children as they can’t really communicate things. Based on what you have written such as not liking books and things, struggling with letters and counting, and having hard time remembering things like songs (possibly a sign or a poor working memory which is a symptom of dyslexia). So based on my limited knowledge of diagnosis I’d be inclined to say it’s high possible he’s dyslexic as I suffered from similar things when I was a child. The best thing to do would be to maybe make a list on on a word document or something of that sort of things that you might want to ask an educational psychologist about. And get him booked into see one after his birthday. I wouldn’t worry about it too much as he’s still young and if he gets the help I’m sure he’ll be fine in things like high school. But it is important to get him the support he needs.",I wouldn’t worry about it too much as he’s still young and if he gets the help I’m sure he’ll be fine in things like high school.

c1xwzux,AnimalRights,"the cause they're supposedly fighting for. PETA employees fight tooth and nail for animals every day, and for pretty low pay (and many for no pay at all). I can't believe that there are folks, **vegan** folks, who still doubt PETA's dedication to liberating animals, even after three decades of successes. As I said before, the cause that PETA fights for wouldn't even be on the public's radar if it weren't for sensationalism. It would be wonderful if this were a respectful world and if respectful tactics would bring the plight of animals into public discourse, but it simply doesn't work. PETA has done studies on how people often get to their website, and a large portion of the time it involves clicking on a so-called scandalous photo of a woman in a chili pepper bikini, or something similar. These tactics *do* work, as evidenced by the fact that PETA is a household name. Not to take anything at all from other great groups, but how many people have heard of Mercy for Animals? How many have heard of Compassion over Killing? These are great groups, but they get no media attention, so most people are unaware of their existence. I'm not sure if you are aware of the enormous gains in the struggle for animal rights that PETA makes every day, but they are unrivaled by any other group. The simple fact is that we live in a media and entertainment obsessed society, and we have to use the tools that are available to us, for the animals. Furthermore, the whole female objectification argument really puzzles me, mostly because PETA is such an enormously female-dominated organization. Believe me, it is mostly women who are dreaming up these stunts. Also, PETA uses semi-nude men in ads and demonstrations quite a bit, but the fact of the matter is that they just don't draw the same amount of attention. Again, not PETA's fault; that's just the way things are and PETA is willing to do what it takes. All that being said, can you tell me what method you think is best for winning this fight? Is there a certain group you like that you think makes more progress than PETA?

,climate,"Interesting, I read briefly through the body of the text you posted. First, the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN) is the first legitimate organization that I've seen with a critique of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), so I am very much interested in this take. The gist of what I'm reading here is that there are certain provisions related to the expansion of (and I agree) greenhouse gas reduction technologies that do not seem to be feasible (i.e., carbon sequestration, etc.). The second main complaint that I see is that grants in the IRA are not necessarily going to be guaranteed to be offered in a way that indigenous tribes will feel competitive with larger NGOs and private organizations in the view of the link. Please let me know if I missed something in the text that should be included here. I think my main disagreement with the text is that the topline summary of opposing universally the IRA does not seem to be justified with the text below that, although I understand the desire to promote things in the strongest way possible. I would have thought that the IEN would be happy with steps to reduce the addition of oil pipelines by switching to renewables (admittedly, there is the Manchin related pipeline in the IRA), a longstanding goal of the IEN. There are definitely things in this bill that are not desirable, and I think how much anyone is willing to accept them is ultimately up to them. I'm not sure that the main statement that this bill is overly focused on fake solutions to the problem is the right one. Having said that, I did find myself agreeing with some of the complaints about parts of the bill. I will just add that most of the environmentally conscious organizations note that while imperfect, this bill will decrease carbon emissions by 40% by the end of the decade. For every ton of carbon removed by the bill's measures, there's 1 ton added in amendments that I think we would agree are not ideal. There's also a huge potential for other countries to follow our lead, potentially multiplying the savings and doing what we need to be doing. To the point in the link about Biden still needing to declare a carbon emergency, this bill does not stop further executive action from bringing the carbon emissions down further this decade. This is a very exciting prospect and probably should have been mentioned, especially since this is the first time the US has taken meaningful action on this topic and is doing so with a razor-thin margin in the houses of congress. There's a lot of good that I see, while I do acknowledge the issues above. I wonder if there's a better way to channel our thoughts on this bill. There is a vote-o-rama coming up on this bill.

h1mmb4a,humanrights,"Yes. The fact that racism exist in our institutions is true. But blaming it on white supremacy is a little misguided. Because everyone on this planet is racist towards black people. The Chinese, Mexicans, Muslims, Jewish and Mormons. So why are white people being singled out? It seems political rather then practical. And then it ignores the why. It doesn't allow for honest discussion about why these people are biased against blacks. And therefore it doesn't allow for the root of the problem to he solved. I remember seeing one Asian lady basically saying she doesn't like Black people but she said in reality she didn't even know any black people. The 2nd thing is the solution. If you think that the solution for black people to be more successful is for white people to act and think differently. I can tell you now that will never work. Like ever. Never in the history of the world has a people become successful because another people became less racist towards them. Success has always come gaining a skill that people will pay for. That will allow you to have a good life. Literally there is no better way to over oppression. And 3rd it says that if you are white you are an oppressor. If you are black you are oppressed. This may be true in some cases but not all cases. LeBron James is just as guilty as benefiting from the genocide of native Americans as everybody else is American. Like no one is on moral high ground here. LeBron benefits from Nike sweatshops but why aren't we calling him an oppressor? So my thing is that its true institute racism is exist but CRT doesn't understand stand why it exist and how to dismantle it. All it does is say racism is happen and its wrong therefor I'm going to be racist from now on. Like how is that a soultion? EDIT: Also saying black people have no power is stupid. Black people are only 13% of America. What do you expect. In Africa black people hold 100% of the positions of power. And to even mention it its not like we don't have black senators, president, police chief, mayors. Like if you look at the numbers thats is also a lie.",Black people are only 13% of America.

cs14fus,climate,"my point about authoritarian control Every modern society maintains a form of authoritarian control over someone. The state is always and only a tool of the rule of one class over another class. In a capitalist country, it's the tool of the capitalist class's rule over the working and peasant classes. In socialism, it's the other way around--the worker, peasant, and former oppressed people's government suppresses the capitalist class and its allies--with the goal of abolishing class and thus the need for a state. There are many capitalist countries today that are just as authoritarian as the USSR was at its worst, and for low-income black and brown people in the United States, it's equally so. What you're lacking is an analysis of who suffers authoritarian control and when. It isn't nearly as necessary in the capitalist Global North because the citizens here are happy with the spoils their imperialist capitalist governments bring home. It's utterly necessary in the capitalist Global South because the citizens there are at the mercy of their neocolonial governments, who enforce the Global North's ruthless and exploitative imperialism. But really, instead of waving your hands, why don't you provide some sources (preferably not ones put out by the sworn enemies of the USSR) to prove the existence and singularness of this authoritarianism instead of relying on Cold War-era cliches to make your points for you?   your first article doesn't really provide any sources for its claims. .. there are in-text citations and a bibliography at the end of it.   Full-employment is useless if the workers aren't actually productive As the article points out, the USSR was the fourth fastest-growing country in the world for the span of its existence. There's no basis for the claim that it was unproductive.   I see Cuba is #44 on that list, which puts them just in the top 25% Pretty exceptional for a country that's been blockaded and under siege for its entire independent existence.   Cuba's primary industry is tourism--tourists with their dirty capitalist money! A good capitalist would acknowledge that the capitalist consumers are getting something for their money or else they wouldn't be paying it. Cuba must be producing something of value, no? At any rate, tourism is a--or *the*--major industry for many other developing countries, but Cuba has managed to parlay it into actual gains for the vast majority of people in the country, not just a few wealthy people. That's what the Human Development Index measures. That it achieved a comparable level of success to Argentina and Chile, two countries that have had massive influxes of foreign capital--the opposite of an embargo and sanctions--indicates that the Cubans' planning has served them far better than remaining at the mercy of imperialist capitalism like their developing-world peers.",".. there are in-text citations and a bibliography at the end of it.

While I am not an expert in the field either of nephrology or physiology I have not heard any mention about the risks of distilled water during medschool aside for the obvious risks when it comes to injecting it or use on tissue that can be damage by non isotonic fluids. This of course doesn't prove anything because of the vast amount of info that needs to be touched upon in such a short period of time but it points towards it not being that important.

,climate,"1 This article completely misrepresents what the INES is used for. Already off to a bad start if that's their first assumption. It is using existing reactor designs which are mostly supposed to come offline in the next 20 years. This would be ok for current risks, but to scale it out 60 years is totally dishonest. most reactors being built now have passive safety systems. The authors have no mention of new reactor designs or a detailed model of what happened at Fukushima. They are working off ""standard operating"" assumptions rather than identifying the problems of those plants being below code, 1/10000 year tsunami, basement generators, outdated/non functioning conduit filters, insufficient auxiliary heat exchangers, ect. All of their data is based off plotting trends along the models they came up with. They even mention at the bottom that multiple specialists have pointed out flaws in their methods but they insist on keeping their conclusions. It also does some statistical deception for example, counting multiple inconsequential immediately dealt with accidents over long periods of time (a container falling off a fork lift as a reportable accident) ""accumulates"" into a full scale melt down. This is just pure dishonesty. The answer to meltdown fears will come in the form of building new reactors. Otherwise more people will die from gas and coal pollution. 2 Its a centrifugal processing system, not a reactor that can get uranium ore into weapons grade materials. Any country that wants to do this can do this without a nuclear reactor. There is no causal mechanism between nuclear reactors for energy and nuclear weapons. Stop assuming I agree with your flawed ideas. 3 Its the default consequence, I used Germany as an example. You think you will be getting solar and wind but you end up with gas. You will also need to bulldoze hundreds of thousands of acres of land to make solar farms or wind farms to match the output of one nuclear plant that sits on a few hundred. Every time you see solar or wind farms, just remember the majority of that name plate is burning carbon. This is common knowledge in the energy sector. Educate yourself. The waste issue? I already answered that. If you had your entire life powered by nuclear, the entirety of that spent fuel would fit inside a soda can. scale that up to entire populations. If it costs 50 billion for long term storage of all nuclear waste of an entire US, then its totally worth it. I wouldn't want to waste it though because its fuel for gen 4 reactors. Answer my question about the solar/wind waste. If you honestly think transmuting the materials will still be an issue in 100 years, you have no idea what you are talking about in terms of nuclear technology. No one in the industry sees this as a major problem. It is safe in the ground but more valuable in gen 4 reactors. I would much rather take a large warehouse worth of nuclear spent fuel from an entire clean energy grid. The alternative is dealing with mountains of toxic waste produced by wind and solar from a grid that is still mostly burning carbon in a world suffering from climate change with less wildlife and ecosystems due to the renewistan land footprint. ""In other words, the land area dedicated to renewable energy (""Renewistan"") would occupy a space about the size of Australia to keep the carbon dioxide level at 450 ppm."" This is taken from a much more in depth research book on the subjects. It basically concludes advanced nuclear is our only option and we need to implement it fast. The nuclear example has already been achieved by 3 nations and others came close on a per capita basis. Every other scenario is pretty much catastrophe. Your dose of radiation from all nuclear energy activities averages out at fractions of a percent. You are bathed in natural radiation from everything else. 4 No source of energy is ""viable"" without government subsidies. I explained this already and provided sources. If you want to complain about government subsidies, look no further than wind or solar, they cost more and give less while keeping the carbon burning. In the US the nuclear industry comes out at a tax after all the regulatory hoops it needs to jump through, yet still remains competitive. IT comes out to -27 billion after all the compliance measures are paid out. BTW a huge chunk of those R D subsidies were dedicated towards navy projects. Others that were civ got blocked by fossil fuel backed politicians like the IFR in the 90s. We had working walkaway reactors in the 90s ready to be built and the gov stepped in and shut everything down after spending billions. Exhibit 1: You have that model backwards, Wind and solar are more expensive with externalities and buffering factored in. You can cherry pick an article saying solar was ""this cheap!"" at high noon on a sunny day, but at night you are still burning carbon. Renewables get feed in tariffs too, I already provided the model of Germany's spending on $300 billion + on renewables and how they get more expensive energy, higher emissions and could have carbonized their entire grid by now if they spent that money on nuclear. ""Ambitious plans"" don't prevent carbon from getting into the atmosphere. I already provided links showing how their emissions went up despite spending 300+Billion on renewables and opened up coal plants. Here is a direct link showing how those ""ambitious plans"" aren't even above a third of their planned track and new coal plants are opening up to compensate for these failures. Using the ""since 1990"" example is a joke because France already mostly decarbonized by then. The rest of the industrialized world could have done the same if people like you would stop fighting it. Thanks for confirming that Germany did open up new coal stations after shutting down nuclear plants, here is an article explaining the hypocrisy of that situation. The NASA article understands fundamental truths about energy systems. Solar and wind are not reliable and always need carbon fuel backups as the majority of their name plate. Hydro is already maxed out, geothermal is only safely feasible in shallow heat regions, mostly maxed out. Nuclear is proven, reliable and safe. Just 100 more nuclear plants in the U.S and we could have displaced carbon entirely. If nuclear development was allowed to continue in the US, we could have been off grid carbon by the mid 90s. My sources are biased? That data came from the congressional budget office. The source was listed right at the bottom of the graph. Your ""baseload fallacy"" is popularized by Mark Jacobson who had his models torn apart in the scientific community and now he wants to sue them because he was that humiliated. He and his entire GCEP department is funded by exxonmobil and other fossil fuel giants. Its funny how you accuse me of being ""biased"" when NASA and the CBO are my sources and you are parroting Jacobson's work who is backed by fossil fuels trying to sell this dangerous and unrealistic fantasy of 100% renewables. This false narrative keeps their carbon burning while nuclear (their biggest competitor) gets shut down. BTW here is the review he is suing for 10 mil over. Mark's rebuttals demonstrates he doesn't understand or care to acknowledge basic fluid dynamics with the hydro example. There are plenty of other blatant flaws in his models. I have spent many hours going over risk assessments and safety of all energy systems and I agree with the scientific consensus that advanced nuclear is the best way forward. I support keeping hydro and geo systems in place, but they are location specific. I don't support building new solar and wind because they keep the carbon burning and are environmentally catastrophic compared to nuclear. When they are installed they are functionally decorations for carbon plants. They don't scale and they require way more resources, money and land to operate while producing more waste. Their EROI's are awful compared to nuclear which also outperforms fossil fuels by that metric.","2 Its a centrifugal processing system, not a reactor that can get uranium ore into weapons grade materials.

,AmIFreeToGo,"It depends on the courthouse, and depends on the judge. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that recording restrictions within a courtroom are constitutional (as well they have to - the Supreme Court itself famously prohibits photography and video recording in their own courtroom, even from the mainstream media). Most state level courts will allow it if you ask for permission first. But for a look at some of the caselaw surrounding courtrooms specifically:  As the previously assigned U.S. Magistrate noted, videotaping of police officers carrying out their duties in a public place is an exercise of First Amendment liberties. See, e.g., *ACLU of Ill. v. Alvarez*, 679 F.3d 583, 600-01 (7th Cir.) (holding that videotaping police officers engaged in their duties in public place protected by First Amendment), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 651, 184 L. Ed. 2d 459 (2012); *Glik v. Cunniffe*, 655 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2011) (finding First Amendment right to film ""government officials engaged in their duties in a public place, including police officers performing their responsibilities""); *Smith v. City of Cumming*, 212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000) (""The First Amendment protects the right to gather information about what public officials do on public property, and specifically, a right to record matters of public interest.""); *Adkins v. Limtiaco*, 537 F. App'x 721, 722 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that allegations that police stopped plaintiff from photographing them at car-crash site and, when he asserted right to do so, confiscated his cellphone and incarcerated him stated claim for First Amendment violation); cf. *Fordyce v. City of Seattle*, 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th Cir. 1995) (recognizing a ""First Amendment right to film matters of public interest"").  Because a county courthouse is a nonpublic forum, however, see *Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Ct.*, 303 F.3d 959, 966 (9th Cir. 2002), the county may regulate and restrict speech inside it as long as the regulations (1) are ""reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum"" and (2) are ""viewpoint neutral."" *Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense   Educ. Fund*, 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985); *Sammartano*, 303 F.3d at 966. With respect to the first prong, ""[t]he [g]overnment's decision to restrict access to a nonpublic forum need only be reasonable; it need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation."" *Cornelius*, 473 U.S. at 808 (emphasis in original).  Defendant Dorta's enforcement of the courthouse ban on unauthorized recording was reasonable because it helped maintain ""established legal procedures in the calmness and solemnity of the courtroom"" necessary to ""the fair and equal administration of justice"" (Cal. R. Ct. 1.150) and because the courthouse is not a public forum for the expression of ideas. Although the cases analyzing whether regulations upon speech in a courthouse violate the First Amendment generally focus only on the courtroom itself, the law is clear that there is no constitutional right to record even judicial proceedings - which are generally of more import to the public at large than the goings-on in the courthouse hallway. See, e.g., *Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.*, 435 U.S. 589, 609-10, 98 S. Ct. 1306, 1318, 55 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1978) (holding that media have no constitutional right to photograph or otherwise electronically record open judicial proceedings despite having right to attend and report on them); *Chandler v. Florida*, 449 U.S. 560, 569, 101 S. Ct. 802, 807, 66 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1981).  Moreover, it is clear that the courthouse itself - and not just the courtrooms or other sites of judicial proceedings - is a nonpublic forum and that justifications for restricting speech there do not depend on whether that speech takes place inside the courtroom. See, e.g., *Sammartano*, 303 F.3d at 966 (holding that judicial and municipal complexes are nonpublic forums); *Sefick v. Gardner*, 164 F.3d 370, 372 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that ""[t]he lobby of the [federal] courthouse is not a traditional public forum or a designated public forum, not a place open to the public for the presentation of views"" and thus ""[n]o one can hold a political rally in the lobby of a federal courthouse""); *Huminski v.

ct9yejd,Vegetarianism,"Cats (all pets realistically) operate on instinct. Humans are the only species given the abilities to apply cognitive reasoning to what our actions are and the affect on surrounding beings relating to dietary choices. So following a specific diet, for health or for other reasons, is something only humans are capable of. Extrapolated, if all humans ate and operated in a vegan fashion, regardless of reason, then there would be a much greater balance in terms of consumption, pollution, animal suffering, and the like. As humans it's a great choice to make, but it is a choice. Pets don't have the ability to make that choice independently, and more so, they don't have the cognitive ability to understand the reasoning behind that type of decision that's being made for them. So in my opinion, if there's better quality food, something created in a manner in fashion that tries to minimize environmental impact and animal suffering, then that's a positive choice to make, but deciding *for* our pets that they should eat or not eat things that aren't natural for their species, isn't the best idea. To a degree, forcing our pets to eat something they don't naturally eat or wouldn't naturally eat is reverse of the principles that we're basing the decision on in the first place. As pet owners, part of our job is to give our pets a happy, healthy home. Our pets would do things that would hurt or injure themselves significantly if we didn't intervene, including with things they try to eat. Preventing them from eating things like household cleaners isn't the same thing as excluding certain things they instinctively want/need to eat. That's the separation I make for my pets. I pay more for quality food that focuses on a whole diet that we scientifically know is good for pets. It has whole ingredients and easily identifiable contents, so less chemicals and unnecessary contents, and thus a better diet for them. Since it's whole ingredients, there's less filler, and theoretically less of an animal impact overall. It's certainly double what I would pay for normal pet food, but it's a step in the right direction. It's not feasible to feed my pets exclusively a salad diet, due to the unknown affect on their health and the fact that they don't get a choice in the matter. Again these are just my opinion and I wouldn't expect to force that type of thinking on anyone here.","As humans it's a great choice to make, but it is a choice.

g80sua0,IronFrontUSA,"Because the current, modern day Antifa was started by Anarchists and is mainly comprised of Anarchists but are accepting of most people willing to fight fascism. The original German Antifa was created in response to the Iron Front. To be in the German Antifa, you had to be a Communist. Their logo had a red flag, representing Socialism, inside a white circle. The current American Antifa has the same flag but with the black flag (anarchism) un top of the red flag (socialism). However, it should be noted that most people who use the Antifa moniker, are not always Anarchists but do hold some anarchist beliefs like anti-capitalism, anti-statism, anti-fascism and anti-authoritarianism and who reject conservative and liberal anti-fascism. Overall, if you want to support Antifa, even if you’re a liberal, Anarchists probably won’t turn you down because we all want to see the end of Fascism. How do you discuss this subject rationally? By pointing out the rationality of Anarchists also wanting the same thing as those who want to work, security, good schools and a good quality of life for every single person. Other than that I’m not really all that concerned with trying to convince people of my beliefs because that in itself is a form of oppression. If someone makes a statement about Anarchism that is incorrect, I will feel it necessary to correct it because I don’t want misconceptions about Anarchism. I think it’s best if people actually learn about Anarchism before they make assumptions. Maybe read about our history from the time of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon up to modern day thinkers like Noam Chomsky. Read about Revolutionary Catalonia, Makhnovia, and the Korean People’s Association in Manchuria. Look up Anarchist Communes around the world that are both around and disbanded.

i2m53iu,publicdefenders,"A few honest thoughts. If you're anything like me, you might find the idea of charging people obscene amounts of money to do really simple things to be pretty repulsive. Hounding them for money or sending them to collections is even worse. Growing up, I would have never been able to afford $3000, $5000, $10000 for a lawyer. Asking people to fork over that level of cash for a DUI, which I know will be easy because I've done 100s of them, is something that I did not enjoy at all. You end up making 'easy money' for clients who are normal and reasonable and you end up making very little (when you break it down to money per hour, which is basically what you have to do because you are running a business) for people who are crazy or have unrealistic expectations. You are incentivized to want easy cases with easy clients and to find creative ways to get around having to deal with difficult people. It is sort of the opposite of the PD ethos where you take every client that comes your way. I never enjoyed this and I just stopped taking private clients altogether. I am clearly in a different social class now than I grew up in, but it will never feel right to me to participate in these sorts of economics. You may also find that if you are an honest, decent person, it could be hard to actually run a business. I tell people what I really think just like I did when I was at the public defender, and I give them my honest assessment of the cost benefit. I will tell people who I believe will qualify to go to the public defender and (likely) get the same outcome for free. To give you an example, here, a first DUI is going to get the same thing almost no matter what (absent a few unusual circumstances that I can typically spot right away). I am not going to lie to people and tell them that paying me $5000 is likely to get them some different result. There are statutes and local DA office policies that get in the way. If someone wants to hire me after I've told them that, by all means I am happy to do so. But there are 100% lawyers out there who will tell people differently, either willfully (if I tell them they are going to get jail, etc., I will pocket an extremely easy $5k) or because of ignorance (I actually don't know what I'm doing and I give my clients bad advice). Lawyers are expensive and, in my view, a lot of people shop around for people who tell them what they want to hear. I don't know how you would have the experience to do all the things you're trying to do. Gaining experience = losing money, making less money. In my view, it is not realistic to be a successful lawyer in every subject area or multiple subject areas without really deep pockets or after already having put a lot of years into your career. I have no doubt you could be a bad lawyer doing all sorts of things you have no experience with. I have no doubt you can get your clients absolutely fucked by ruining their cases and getting ordered to pay the other side's inflated attorneys fees. Hiring people is very challenging in a private firm and my personal opinion is that many if not most employees may not be worth the cost. Every cent you pay to them is money that doesn't go to you. And these costs (rent, furniture, taxes, IT stuff, etc.) add up to real money very quickly. For the employee that actually makes your life easier, it is worth it. But my experience has been that many employees did not deliver value for money. I would much rather do things myself to get things done the first time. It is different when you are in a firm with 20 attorneys, but as a solo practitioner or small firm, the economics become more and more challenging--especially if doing good is part of your mission--the more overhead you have. This is a noble goal you have and I hope you can achieve it. I know some folks who are kind of sort of doing what you're doing with a similar plan, although less broad spectrum in terms of the type of cases they handle. But you will be doing a lot of work of running a business and less lawyering. If you're trying to really achieve what you're doing, you will also end up working 24/7. I know lawyers like that and they seem happy, but that isn't the life for me but maybe it is for you.","Lawyers are expensive and, in my view, a lot of people shop around for people who tell them what they want to hear.

d1b7mp1,WhiteRights,"This is good reading. It seems he is arguing that whites get brownie points for self hate. This is true. I have seen this many times. But I have also seen the self satisfaction that white liberals have from hating their own race. They feel really special and good about themselves when they hate whites. His claim that self hating whites act out of self interest, requires there to be social benefit from self hating. This is certainly true. If I started feigning hatred of whites, I would be rewarded by liberals. But this begs the question again - how and why? Why are so many whites so quick to to reward other whites for participating in white genocide. How did society end up structured this way?

go4zcw6,Vegetarianism,"Well I’m not a biologist but as far as I’m aware plants and fungi have no nervous system, no neurons, no hint of any kind of information processing ability, let alone capacity for complex emotional response. We really don’t know enough to say that. It’s true that plants and fungi don’t have neurons, as far as we’re aware, but they absolutely do process information sometimes in surprisingly complex ways. They can communicate between cells, and even between organisms. And we also don’t have much evidence to support the idea that shrimp or insects have the capacity for complex emotional responses. It certainly is not obvious that they have the capacity to experience emotions anywhere near the level of a human or other mammal.   They’re just tubes that react to chemical stimuli. They don’t have behaviour. I mean, we’re just tubes that react to chemical stimuli too. You literally just described a neuron. And I don’t think it’s fair to say they don’t have behavior. The behavior of plants and fungi is certainly less obvious and fast as an animal, but they do change their biochemical systems in response to stress or other external stimuli. But if you don’t want to count that as behavior, we can focus on the example of insects instead.   We don’t know if consciousness is a byproduct of information processing, or if it is the reason behind it, but know that it’s needed (in us at least) to be able to have emotions and self awareness etc. Plants have no capacity to be able to do it from what I know, so it’s not worth debating over in my opinion because as an animal I have to consume some kind of organic matter in order to live, and if it’s between a sentient creature with emotions and feelings, or a tube that can do nothing but react to light and temperature then I’ve got my answer cut out for me to be honest. This is begging the question though. We don’t know that shrimp are sentient, or if they have emotions or feelings. We also don’t know that plants, fungi, or insects don’t have any of those things. It’s true that we seem to be conscious as a result of activity in the brain, but we have absolutely no idea how that works. It could be that literally anything that processes information has some form of consciousness, including our individual cells, a plant, or even a thermostat. It’s even possible that some form of panpsychism is true, and even such simple things as fundamental particles have some form of consciousness. We really just don’t know. I agree with you that it’s simply not practical to give moral consideration to something just because we can’t rule out the possibility that it is conscious, but that’s my whole point. Just because a shrimp might be conscious doesn’t automatically mean that we should grant it moral consideration. In my opinion, we should grant moral consideration to beings based on their ability to experience suffering, **weighted** by our confidence that they have such ability.","They can communicate between cells, and even between organisms.

d9fcach,Political_Revolution,"Trump called the Geneva convention problematic because we're expected to treat foreign Prisoners of War with dignity, while captured americans face torture, decapitation and having body parts removed. Also, for the record, the US has already grossly violated the Geneva Convention in the past, in part under obama's administration (see: Abu Ghraib.) Trump calling into question it's problematic nature pales in comparison to ACTUALLY torturing prisoners. Mr. Trump, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, said he would “use every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.” Arming the US to defend against nuclear attacks is no where near as dangerous for the American people as threatening war with Russia in order to promote yourself politically (see: Hillary Clinton.)   More damaging than opening fire on Troops from on Iran because they mocked us? Not even sure what you're talking about here?

But if you actually read the New Testament, it's clear on the central tenets of Christianity: have faith, love, and be free from your old habits (sin). That isn't to say we can't go back. It just points us in the right direction, with modern science to back those suggestions up. Off the top of my head, the command to love and honor your spouse in a faithful marriage. Psychology studies have shown that people in faithful and happy marriages are much less prone to a range of diseases, for instance. You're free to argue modern science, for that is what science is about. But please, at least understand what you're arguing against!","Religious rites may be inherited, but faith is not.

Like any sufficiently powerful sovereign nation, it isn't particularly difficult to find valid criticism. I'm tired of tacit whataboutism arguments made by supporters of Israel directed towards the United States because the same people who support Israel's treatment of Palestinians are the same people who so cavalierly ignore atrocities committed by the authoritarians in the United States against BIPOC. I'm tired of knowing that many Israeli politicians are exceptionally intelligent and I have long suspected that as a result of being an oppressed people, many of them have adopted realpolitik and pragmatic solutions as a way of reconciling centuries of systemic oppression based upon make believe conspiracy theories and irrational theories. I'm willing to concede that Israel has been ultimately facing the consequence of aligning itself with the United States (foreign policy goals shifted after the fall of the USSR), and while they had great power to leverage they choose aligning with the United States because the United States represented democracy. Contrast this with the rhetoric in the United States over the last half-decade where many in the US heavily criticized the GOP for aligning themselves with Putin -- that would have been the reaction in the 90's had Israel decided to maintain neutrality or choose to align themselves with another hegemonic power. The reality is that they afforded themselves a seat at the big table and their conduct there helps shape global policy, good and bad. And the question is about to what degree do they recognize that?

However, it is not inconsistent with the idea that fetuses are innocent and killing them even in that situation would still be murder under their twisted PoV.) But really, all of this is consistent when you understand that foundation of prolife sits atop another foundation: consistent historical precedent for misogyny. 2) Even if these people are fringe outliers and people push back against it, it can serve a secondary effort for prolife political parties: getting people to compromise on their human rights. This is something that can and will be taken advantage of in regards to the Dobbs vs Whole Women's Health case before SCOTUS. The 15 week abortion ban. In contrasting it with things like 6 week bans, a 15 week ban doesn't look so bad. So it will get spun by well-meaning but ignorant news media outlets as a win cause ""at least it isn't a 15 week ban."" Meanwhile, they chipped away even further at our rights to our own body.

c2ynsga,Vegetarianism,"Hey OP. Just want to piggy back on majority of posts with a few pieces of advice that I've picked up along the way: First, it is true that if you want to start gaining extra muscle you need to put in a bit more protein - that being said however, the amount of extra protein needed that the industry will lead you to believe is grossly overdone. The human body doesn't need nearly so much protein in order to maintain/gain muscle. Second - you don't need as much protein on a vegetarian diet for another reason (this only applies for plant-based protein as far as I know). Plant-based protein is easily recognized by the body and thus requires less energy to break down and assimilate compared to animal-protein. Thus, the net gain you receive from plant-based protein is actually higher than animal-protein. On top of that, there's usually a number of other nutrients available from plant-based proteins that help make the body stronger in different ways than just muscle formation (depends on your diet of course - and this is not suggesting that similar nutrients can be found in animal products). Third - Good sources of protein are hemp powder, quinoa, beans, nuts (and their milks), lentils, avocados, bananas, millet, brown rice products (the less processed the better, as goes with any food), and don't forget that most all vegetables DO also have protein as well - a great source example is broccoli. Fourth - I won't tell you not to consume them (as it's your personal choice), but be conscious of the fact that certain animal products like milk or other dairies can actually hinder the body's ability to 'become stronger' (for lack of a better saying), even though you may think they're a nutritious source of protein. For example, milk in the stomach becomes acidic, thus causing your body to draw on bodily sources of calcium (i.e. your bones usually), in order to neutralize the acidity. This can lead to bone weakness if not properly monitored, or overconsumed. A GREAT resource for athletes on a vegan diet is Brandon Brazier's ""Thrive Diet"" (where much of the above information has come from). He goes into detail about all the nutrients, bodily processes, and foods that are essential for athletes, plus has a lot of great recipes you can make use of the new ingredients you'll find. Very highly recommended, I drink all my morning smoothies based off his recipes and I've never felt better. Also, another good video to watch in general is ""Forks over Knives"" which is where I picked up the bit about milk in the body. Good luck, and let me know if you need further details about anything!","Plant-based protein is easily recognized by the body and thus requires less energy to break down and assimilate compared to animal-protein.

evjxa71,IronFrontUSA,"A far better solution would be to have proper and open counselling and treatment options for paedophilic urges. At the moment those who have these feelings run the very real risk of being made into criminals if they seek help (some states in the US have mandatory reporting where counsellors have to report any stuff to do with paedophilia to the police even where there's little to no evidence an actual crime has been committed) whilst the counsellors who are skilled enough to handle stuff like this face the issue they can't openly advertise that they are prepared to work with paedophiles for fear of the flaming torches and pitchfork brigade who can't seem to seperate 'feelings towards kids' from 'actually doing something to a kid'.

(I expect that would vary by state) However, even if they aren't violating any laws, you can still complain. If the program is accredited, make a complaint to the organization that accredits it; accrediting organizations have their own standards for accreditations that are often stricter than law. For my complaint, I emailed the director of the accrediting agency and asked him about the complaint process, and asked him how much information the board would need to initiate an investigation. (They don't *need* 88 pages of information, I just went full ham because I want to make sure that the school is on the hook for everything they did.) As part of your complaint, you may want to provide a statement regarding how the issue has personally affected you, to drive home that the problem has had real-world effects and isn't just hypothetically problematic. You can complain to your state's department of education if it was a school RTC. The complaint itself would be very similar to the complaint for the accrediting agency. Some states have vague, general rules for schools (such as a school must provide a safe environment with appropriate resources) that leave room for a school to be investigated even if it isn't breaking a specific law. If the therapy that was provided was abusive or if the therapists ignored their roles as mandated reporters, it is possible you could complain to other agencies as well, like the state's CPS or department of families (or the equivalent agency), etc. I have not actually made my complaints yet, so I don't have much insight to give about how to navigate things after making a complaint. And all of this that I just said may be different depending on what you want to get out of a complaint. I can't give any advice regarding what to do if you want a personal lawsuit or a class-action lawsuit. If you want a settlement, making an agency complaint could harm your chances of getting a settlement. But if you just want to make the program change or possibly get shut down, then you don't need to worry about those other things.","If the therapy that was provided was abusive or if the therapists ignored their roles as mandated reporters, it is possible you could complain to other agencies as well, like the state's CPS or department of families (or the equivalent agency), etc. I have not actually made my complaints yet, so I don't have much insight to give about how to navigate things after making a complaint.

I might need a fire-breathing taskmaster, haha. - I’ve tried several group formats (including the mastermind kind) but I encountered the same problems over and over: someone slowly fades out and stops checking in, someone uses it as a time to vent about personal problems that are for a therapist, some just stop talking about progress and it becomes essentially a friendly chat, personality clashes, etc. And I can’t be in a group with others with ADHD because we always just seem to enable each other’s bad habits. - I tried partnering up with friends, family, and people in a similar work area.

,activism,"Your request is extremely vague, and most studies are focused on a certain aspect. Still, here's some general studies on GMO safety. As per your request, I've done my best to eliminate studies from Monsanto, but I may have missed one or two.  Judging from these results, the transgenic potatoes with glycinins are confirmed to have nearly the same nutritional and biochemical characteristics as non-transgenic one.  During the test period, the rats in every group grew well without marked differences in appearance, food intake, body weight, or cumulative body weight gain. There were also no significant differences in the blood count, blood composition or internal organ weights among the rats. Necropsy at the end of the experiment indicated neither pathological symptoms nor histopathological abnormalities in the liver and kidney. Judging from these results, the rice genetically modified with glycinin is considered to have been essentially the same in nutritional and biochemical characteristics as the control rice.  The transgenic N7070Bt and N7070Bt + Liberty hybrid diets supported excellent broiler chicken growth with mortality and FCR that were similar to that supported by the N7070 isoline control and better than rates from the commercial NC2000 corn without significant differences among treatment groups in carcass yield. It was clear that the transgenic corn had no deleterious or unintended effects on production traits of broiler chickens in this study.  There were no differences for nutrient composition between silage sources or between grain sources within an experiment. Data for experiments 1 and 2 indicated similar dry matter intake (DMI), 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM) production, and milk composition between Bt-MON810 and Bt-CON diets. There were no differences for DMI, 4% FCM production, and milk composition between RR-GA21 and RR-CON diets. There was no difference in ruminal degradability, determined separately for corn silage and corn grain, for RR-GA21 or Bt-MON810-hybrids compared with their respective controls. These data demonstrate equivalence of nutritional value and production efficiency for corn containing Bt-MON810 compared with its control and for RR-GA21 corn compared with its control.  The results showed that the transgenic foodstuffs had no effect on macromolecular synthesis or cell growth and differentiation as evidenced by no differences in the percentages of testicular cell populations (haploid, diploid, and tetraploid) between the transgenic soybean-fed mice and those fed the conventional diet. Additionally, there were no differences in litter sizes and body weights of the two groups. It was concluded that the transgenic soybean diet had no negative effect on fetal, postnatal, pubertal or adult testicular development.  There were no apparent differences in percentages of testicular cell populations (haploid, diploid, and tetraploid) between the mice fed the Bt corn diet and those fed the conventional diet. Because of the high rate of cell proliferation and extensive differentiation that makes testicular germ cells highly susceptible to some toxic agents, it was concluded that the Bt corn diet had no measurable or observable effect on fetal, postnatal, pubertal, or adult testicular development. If data from this study were extrapolated to humans, Bt corn is not harmful to human reproductive development.  There were no significant differences between GM potatoes G2, G3, and Spunta control potato line in the proximate chemical composition. The levels of glycoalkaloids in transgenic potato tubers and nontransgenic were determined and there were also no significant differences between the GM potatoes and conventional potato line, the levels were in agreement with a safety level recommended by FAO/WHO (200 mg/ kg) for acute toxicity. Protease inhibitor activity and total phenol were estimated and no significant differences between the GM potatoes line and conventional potato Spunta line were found. During the period tested, rats in each group (I, II, III, IV) grew well without marked differences in appearance. No statistical difference were found in food intake, daily body weight gain and feed efficiency. But there is a slightly significant difference in finally body weight between the control group and experimental groups. No significant difference were found in serum biochemical value between each groups, and also between relative organs weight (liver, spleen, heart, kidney, testes). From these results, it can be concluded that the GM potatoes Spunta line (G2 and G3) with Cry V gene are confirmed to have nearly the composition and biochemical characteristics as non-GM potato Spunta.  CONCLUSION: From the results of the 90 days feeding test of transgenic rice on rats there did not reveal any signs of toxic and adverse effects. If this list wasn't enough for you, I can go find you some more. There's an absurdly large amount of studies out there, the biggest issue is filtering through them all for the ones meeting the criteria you requested.","Judging from these results, the rice genetically modified with glycinin is considered to have been essentially the same in nutritional and biochemical characteristics as the control rice.

ebq6028,EndFPTP,"Because it's the only ""spectacular"" failure mode of approval voting, IMO. Most other failures are edge cases where a majority of voters like some set of {A, B, C} of candidates; A is the ""true"" winner among the populace by some small margin but bullet voters push B or C over the top by a little. Not a huge issue because the utility loss from the population as a whole is negligible. On the other hand, a Burr Dilemma can directly cause the system to elect a candidate who should not reasonably win because a wide majority supports other candidates.

cimxeb2,neurodiversity,"Sorry I took so long to reply. I was looking for articles on the topic, but couldn't find much.   I would dispute this. Distancing oneself from pathology is not the same as distancing oneself from neurodiversity, unless you also assume that neurodiversity itself is automatically pathological. I agree that neurodiversity isn't necessarily pathological. I'm neurodiverse, but I don't prefer the medical model. However, it's almost always *seen* as pathological, because that's the ableist society in which we live. Though I couldn't find any articles, I did find [this post]( by tumblr blogger nettlefae. It gets at some of the same points I'm trying to make. I'll continue to look for articles about it, but in the meantime, I hope this will help you to understand my position a little better. Edit: I forgot that I also wanted to mention my interest in the idea that societal violence is caused by mental illness. This is a pretty good example of something that I think is necessary to fight in order to help the neurodiverse, even though not all neurominorities identify as having a mental illness. Regardless of how I identify, the persistent belief that ""mental illness"" is to blame for mass shootings still affects me. It's ableist, stigmatizing, and it allows for the persistence of oppression.","I agree that neurodiversity isn't necessarily pathological. I'm neurodiverse, but I don't prefer the medical model.

e6ksfvv,AnimalRights,"Grumpy? Complicit? I volunteered in an animal rescue facility for 4 years in high school. Now, In my area, they jokingly call me 'the bird man', as everyone knows if they find a hurt or orphaned bird, they can reach out to me and I'll come pick it up. (Snakes and lizards too). Care for them till I can release them or give them a quiet warm place to spend their last hours on Earth. (The latter of the two is a service of compassion as I know there are some so badly wounded or in shock that there is no recovery. Most often this is a father/daughter combo. When I take the bird from them, I reassure them promising the bird will be warm and safe. They leave feeling good about trying to help and I take on the burden of the creature's passing. If in pain, I end them with as much mercy as I can. If not, I've built a recuperation box, with the help of a vet working at the Audubon society. If the bird makes it overnight, then I work on recuperation. And if efforts are successful, when time to release, I contact the Audubon society again to inquire where locally the particular type of bird species may be frequenting due to food or water supply and I release the bird there. Mostly large arboretum's or large botanical gardens. I rescue so many, that these facilities know me and allow me to walk in, no charge, any time so I can release these rescued birds. And just because I didn't put my family or myself at risk in this situation makes me the bad guy. That is plain ignorance!

ini8jh7,europrivacy,"To be clear, Tutanota never stooped so low as this Fathom example. But just like Fathom, Tutanota tends to imply that its technology is more essential for compliance than it is. ## Tutanota's marketing repeatedly overstates GDPR compliance This got really annoying back when GDPR was new and Tutanota pumped out a lot of content marketing along the following lines: * GDPR mentions encryption * our email service offers optional end-to-end encryption (E2EE) * other services don't offer E2EE * implication: your business is noncompliant and due to get fined if you don't switch to our service A (mild) example of this from 2018, incidentally also involving Denmark, is A stronger example, where Tutanota misleadingly claims that using their service “guarantees” compliance, is (posted literally the day before GDPR came into force...). To be fair, not so bad in isolation, but I got fed up after feeling bombarded by these content marketing posts as an r/gdpr moderator. ## Consequences of Tutanota's encryption But the main reason why I don't like Tutanota are more technical: * Tutanota's encryption at rest produces strong lock-in effects * Tutanota's E2EE is incompatible with the wider email ecosystem * Tutanota's security claims are not well explained ## Tutanota's encryption at rest produces strong lock-in effects In order to get E2EE, you need a client software to decrypt emails. Thus, Tutanota locks you in to their email client. You can't use other IMAP-compatible email clients. This makes sense on a technical level, but it represents a high degree of lock-in. * Competitor Protonmail at least offers a bridge software that acts as an E2EE client on one end and exposes the data via IMAP on the other, so that normal email clients can be used on desktop computers. * To me, such lock-in also raises GDPR- and other compliance issues, for example related to email archiving, and being able to search emails throughout an organization for legal discovery or for GDPR access requests. ## Tutanota's E2EE is incompatible with the wider email ecosystem E2EE only works if both ends of the communication support the encryption method. Thus, we currently have at least four incompatible ecosystems for E2EE emails: * S/MIME * PGP * Tutanota * Protonmail To be fair, S/MIME and PGP are really bad compared to the current state of the art like the Signal messenger, but they have to work within the confines of the legacy protocol that is email. So while Tutanota may offer encryption at rest, most emails that you'll send to external communication partners simply cannot offer E2EE. The [alternative solution Tutanta offers for encrypted messages to external recipients]( * you exchange a password with the communication partner * when you send an encrypted email to non-Tutanota (standard email) users, all they'll get is a link to a Tutanota site * at that link, they can enter the password to see the message I think this defeats the purpose of email, at least from the perspective of the recipient. ## Tutanota's security claims are not well explained The website seems to contain no technical whitepaper that details their encryption method. * They have a security overview that mentions using AES-128 and RSA-2048 and Base64-encoding (lol), but there are many ways to get those severely wrong. How are keys generated? What AES block chaining mode is used? Their marketing material criticizes the lack of forward secrecy and quantum resistance in PGP, but how does Tutanota's method ensure those – especially since RSA is the poster child for non-quantum-resistant algorithms and has various other problems? Why even use RSA then instead of the far more efficient Curve25519? * I am not saying that Tutanota is doing bad work, but for security-critical software I'd like to see more documentation. I could sludge through their [client clode]( which, to their credit, is Open Source GPL-licensed, but I'd rather not do that. Still, whatever Tutanota does, it's probably less insane than the home-brew MTProto 1.0 protocol Telegram used to use. (Edit: changed nested lists to sections so that the post renders correctly on old   new Reddit)","* To me, such lock-in also raises GDPR- and other compliance issues, for example related to email archiving, and being able to search emails throughout an organization for legal discovery or for GDPR access requests. ## Tutanota's E2EE is incompatible with the wider email ecosystem E2EE only works if both ends of the communication support the encryption method.

ccs97qq,WhiteRights,"I'll repeat the basic insight I had on this topic, because I think it is of crucial importance to an understanding of what's going on. Would white Christians suddenly and spontaneously start hating their own religion, their own history as a people, their own culture? Up until the second half of the 19th century, whites celebrated their achievements with pride in their literature. They made no apologies for being Christian, or for being white. None at all. Read Kipling or Kingsley for an idea of what true white pride is all about. They were the best the world had ever seen, and they knew it, and they weren't afraid to celebrate it. Suddenly, that changed. We started to see essays come out attacking white culture and white achievements. They presented whites as oppressors and rapacious warmongers. There were more and more of them. This attitude began to appear in novels and short stories. It began to be taught in the universities. Marxism accelerated this sowing of white guilt, and white self-hatred. By the 1920s, you couldn't call yourself an intellectual if you didn't feel contempt for Christianity and the white race. But why did this change take place? Did it just happen, spontaneously, of itself? Did whites suddenly begin to feel scorn and contempt for themselves? Did they just suddenly decide to hate their own skin color? My insight is that it didn't just happen on its own. It was caused by a sustained media campaign extending over decades. The minds of whites couldn't be poisoned against themselves overnight -- it took tens of years, the better part of a century, to really accomplish it. And who was in the control of the media during this period? White Christians? No, it was the Jews. It didn't make sense that whites would begin to suddenly hate themselves, *because they did not!* Whites were made to hate themselves over many, many years of daily anti-Christian, anti-white propaganda. All of us have grown up in a sea of anti-white propaganda without even realizing it. It is so familiar to us, we never stop to question it. We are steeped in it, from birth. This anti-white propaganda was deliberately, consciously crafted by Jews, for the purpose of destroying the white race. Part of that campaign of destruction involves destroying the Christian religion, because Christianity is the white religion. It is an expression of our race. Christianity didn't make us, we made Christianity. It expresses the virtues that are natural to the white race. The Christian moral code is our moral code. And Jews hate and despise it. They have always hated it, because it is opposed to all that they stand for. So what was my essential insight? That self-hatred of whites for their own race and their own religion was not spontaneous, but was deliberately caused by those who controlled the mass media -- the Jews. I should add that others have expressed this thesis more eloquently than I ever could. Read the writings of Kevin MacDonald for the best expression of why whites have come to hate their own race.","My insight is that it didn't just happen on its own.

Because we encourage art and education in our children. Would you say it's fair to say that Italians dominate the pasta industry?

I can't stop you.   If that's the case, according to your claim Jews must be black too? So why are you so bad at sports? Yes, there are black Jews and most Jews are as black as Italians. But bad at sports? Are you not familiar with some of the best boxers of all time, include Max Baer - the man who nearly killed James Braddock? How about all the Jews who went to the last Olympic games? A much higher percentage of the Jewish population than the Italian athletes were of their population... but I guess your racist statistics only work in one direction. :-/   Anyways, the primary problem with Jews isn't genetic; it's cultural. Jews adopt the culture of their country of origin. Your problem is cultural - you're a bigot.   I have a huge problem with your culture. Genetically Ashkenazi Jews are reasonably intelligent. The problem is that they seem to use that intelligence to screw non-Jews over. Your problem is blindness, and your problems are your own.

If your family is abusive, and they have been abusive for a long time it is most likely they will always stay abusive. I recommend going NC (no contact) with them as soon as possible. 6. I live in Florida, and thankfully there are many resources in Florida for students. FAFSA, Bright futures, etc. Are a few examples that could pay for your tutuion instate universities/colleges. 7.

Im in the exact same situation as you. Im preparing to move out by next year when im 18. I know you can do it. Itll just take time. 8. I want you to slowly separate yourself from your parents.

hza8cje,Dyslexia,"My experience is with American universities, but generally the best way to assess dyslexia-friendliness is to just talk to the department in charge of providing you with support. I had to apply for accommodations before starting both my degrees. When I got my Bachelor's *everything* was through email. I didn't talk to a single live person. My emails were not responded to in a timely manner. And the university made it clear that if I wanted to *use* any of the accommodations they were granting, I had to arrange for that in advance with my professors and the university. Information about accommodations was really hard to find on the website, too. When I got my Master's, some of the application was through email but they actually responded to things within 36 hours. They also required students to talk through disability related paperwork in person, with a *case manager.* I was given a lot of information about when I needed to file paperwork to get accommodations, their disability stuff was easy to find online and I think the website even had a template for contacting professors about a disability. Unsurprisingly, the place I went for my BA was not even a little dyslexia friendly. The process of getting extra time sucked. I was alternately forced to take tests while sitting between two ""observers"" who were supposed to make sure I got my extra time without cheating. Or I was left to take tests alone in a room *filled* with opportunities to cheat (I didn't. I actually failed one quiz on purpose because they made me take it *right next to the reading material I was being quizzed on* and I thought the professor was trying to set me up for an academic integrity violation.) Eventually I just started picking classes based on whether I could pass them without accommodations. The place I got my Master's degree was absolutely lovely. Getting my accommodations was a breeze (compared to how it normally goes,) I had access to loads of extra help if I wanted it, and I got to take my extra time in a quiet distraction free area (devoid of cheating opportunities so I felt safe.)","Information about accommodations was really hard to find on the website, too.

gehaure,europrivacy,"Here:   No, the fact that Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway or Poland (to name but a few) imposed strict measures against Covid does not mean they are in danger of slaughtering 6 million Jews tomorrow. You put in my mouth that spying on the citizens leads to being literally Hitler. No matter how delusional you are, at no point in this conversation (or at all) did I say that. What I did say however is that the government (and yes, governments ultimately act in similar ways) does not like to give up privileges. It's exactly the same thing as with taxes - do you know how many ""temporary"" tax raises were never withdrawn? And what adds to that is that political climate and governments change over time, so if a liberal government gains some privilege now, a possible future less liberal government will retain them. I did not say that accumulation of privileges *leads* to bad governments. And you're the one doing propaganda here - by mentioning science.

Rein in and dismantle your corporate driven imperialism. 3. Round up your billionaires and use their ill gotten hordes to pay for national humane centric public infrastructure. 4. Organise community level co-ops to grow market gardens in public parks and other accessible areas. 5.

In accordance with numbers 1  2 ... stop paying huge amounts of money to other countries to do your dirty work for you ... you've been duped. 10. Introduce a universal basic income. I think you'll be amazed how quickly other peoples will be able to sort their own shite out and your own population will be a lot more stress free as wealth is better managed and distributed.

,Intactivism,"Females prefer dried up immobile crippled dicks. Or do they....? Samantha Davis James Fiddler yes!!! Omg yes!! My husband is 32, almost 33, intact, not one single issue. I’ve been with 7 men. 6 were cut and my husband is the only intact man I’ve ever been with. Holy magical difference!!! 😱😍 being intact is exactly how nature intended and how sex was intended to be!! I feel so sorry for anyone who never gets to experience this feeling!! Sarah Ruiz I am 35 and I have been with a handful of men before I met my husband and they were all cut, every one of them. It wasn’t until I was with my husband that I found out what multiple orgasms felt like ! ! Yes whole magical new world 🎊I also noticed my husbands orgasms lasted longer then I had ever seen a guy last so ... yeah being intact is natural,it has functions and it does affect sex for men and for WOMEN ! Tayna Kumma I also hate when men try to play this card, and my man does it too, that well dad’s are the ones with the penises so wouldn’t they know better than the moms? Alright man you wanna be like that, pretty sure it’s mostly women who know what it is like to have sex both with and without a foreskin. Personally I’ve found that intact men can be more passionate and more concerned with the pleasure I experience as well as their own. My man is circumcised and I love him anyway lol but we joke at times how he’s got to “beat me up” before he can finish (not all the time, just, ya know). And sometimes I need to deny access to recover. Makes me wonder how different my sex life might be if his parents brought a whole baby home and I’m pretty sure both my son and his future girlfriends will thank me 😂 [**Sofia Sundari**]( I’ve been very curious about this. Almost all my partners have been circumcised, and only the current one is not. And... well I have to say I feel a big difference. And I am enjoying the feeling, plus the sensitivity and responsiveness of his cock. But I’m far from making it into statistics. Yet I think we need to be really careful about the way we spread this information. It’s quite challenging to reverse circumcision, from what I understand. And by trying to de-shame the society we shouldn’t create more shame or feeling of inadequacy, this time for men who are circumcised. Charis Amanda The 3 cut men I have had a relationship with...needed lube to fuck. Needed lube to masturbate. I know this is TMI but I have only been with 2 intact men. And this last guy...proved to me it wasnt ME who was the problem. I was wetter than wet. And I STAYED that way...the entire. Seven. Hours. We. Fucked. AND I HAD NO PAIN THE NEXT DAY!!!! Audrey Wilson Cut men are almost IMPOSSIBLE to get off with just a blowjob or handjob. And for the one's giving...it's exhausting. 😥 So fucking sad. Circumcision RUINED sex. Reply: Lori Starnes Yup. This is what cut many men do not realize. 😞 Sex with them is extra work I.e. compensation. Sex is not supposed to be painful. Sex happens more often and for longer periods of time, without compensation or pain with intact men. Cortney Carter My ex could only masturbate by laying down and using his palm to rub where his frenulum used to be. There was no even jerking off. He just had sensation in that one place. When we first met, I was young, and thought it was odd that he could only get off like that, he didn't masturbate in the shower, etc, but it took me awhile to put two and two together and when I did, I was so sad for him. He also could barely feel BJs. We were together for like 14 years and never once did a BJ do anything for him. And I'm, \*ahem\* not too shabby at them. Our sex life was beyond subpar because it hurt me. Circumcision harms, absolutely. I will never stop talking about this. Stop fucking up males' sex lives the second they enter the world. Karissa Best The only circumcised man I have slept with, he lasted hours and used to get frustrated. His penis was basically not sensitive enough. He didn't even bother self pleasuring himself....😢 poor guy. All other men I've met are intact and are grateful. They have no issues and tell me that their foreskins have definitely served purpose. Also the whole end of his penis was scarred (hence the lack of nerves etc).... it was scary and sad to see. Lauri Hale The few cut men I've been with were definitely desensitized... Sex seemed like a lot of work. My first serious boyfriend and my ex-husband were both intact. The circumcised guys are definitely not getting the full experience 😕 Tiffany Blaize Same experience here, it took a lot of pounding to satisfy my ex cut partner 😱😕😩 [**Sofia Sundari**]( I’ve been very curious about this.

Jill Nesbitt I had numerous frequent UTIs with cut partners... after being with 3 intact men I realized the issue was just that, a lack of foreskin. Lack of foreskin can cause tearing inside the vagina which will then allow bacteria in. I've now been with my intact husband for over 4 years and have never once gotten an infection from him. I also had alot of trouble climaxing with cut men (I can count on both hands with every single cut man I've been with) but literally no problems at all with intact men. My husband can get the job done in minutes... I never thought I'd experience that with a man. Of course we don't like to think of our children having sex but knowing what I know I could never deprive my kids of what they deserve...a natural sexual experience. Never ever will I cut my children. Adrianna Jensen I much preferred my experiences with intact men.

,EvolveSustain,"I really hate headlines like this as it is misleading and will be used by the corporate parties and to claim the climate change science is really an agenda to end private businesses and jobs and 'socialize' the economy. The fact is we do not have 'capitalism' and in most countries the economic system is regulated commerce. That system works well when governments will actually regulate businesses so that the safety and health of the planet and people are put ahead of profits and wealth creation. The problem is NOT capitalism but a break down in that regulatory process that has allowed industries and corporations to pollute the planet, kill people with their products and amass monumental wealth with no regard for our future. When countries do actually regulate industries and corporation based on those needs then regulated commerce works well and it provides a way for all people to get the products and resources and services they need to survive but within limits to prevent the damage to the environment and over use or resources. I agree with the article that the problem is mass wealth creation: ""There is a poverty line below which no one should fall, and a wealth line above which no one should rise. We need wealth taxes, not carbon taxes"" That again is a problem created by deregulation of commerce and not capitalism. We absolutely should have limits on wealth and anything above a reasonable limit should be collected and returned to society to promote the health and safety of the people and planet. That is how the tax system in most countries is supposed to work but because those corporations have a special tax code with lots of loopholes you now have corporations that pay nothing in taxes and some that are collecting trillions in tax payer subsidies while they destroy the planet and kill people. ""According to the research, exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, from burning fossil fuels was responsible for about 8.7 million deaths globally in 2018.

World spends $423 billion a year to subsidize fossil fuels, UN research says I just read that Elon Musk is now worth $3 billion dollars and NO PERSON should ever be allowed to accumulate that much wealth. It is a fact that the US and wealthy countries that are major consumers are the primary drivers of climate change: ""The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average is closer to 4 tons. In 2019, CO2 emissions per capita for China was 8.12 tons of CO2 per capita. The average carbon footprint of every person in India was estimated at 0.56 tonne per year– with 0.19 tonne per capita among the poor and 1.32 tonne among the rich.

So while I agree with the article I just wish they would stop using the misleading term of 'capitalism' as the enemy which will only turn businesses and working people against the transition to an equitable system of regulated commerce and that is focused on the health and safety of the planet and people instead of wealth creation and corporate profits.",I really hate headlines like this as it is misleading and will be used by the corporate parties and to claim the climate change science is really an agenda to end private businesses and jobs and 'socialize' the economy.

fthr8fg,prochoice,"Hi, welcome and thanks for your two cents. There are some things I'd like to point out though.   I’m not opposed to birth control because it doesn’t kill anyone Actually, most abortions don't directly kill, they let die. Killing would imply causing lethal and direct bodily harm. Most abortions don't even touch the fetus's body while it's alive; they simply stop the woman's body from caring for it via cutting the placenta or stopping her production of proestrogen, which causes the fetus to die naturally. By this logic, I'd consider some cases of using contraceptives to be killing as well, due to them stopping any fertilized egg/zygote from implanting which then causes it to be flushed out and die. Both of these situations operate on the same principles: depriving the unborn human of use of your body, which results in their death. Which I think a woman has the right to do, seeing as it's her body that abortion exercises control over. Also the fact that, in every first aid class I've ever been in, you're not supposed to help someone if it's unsafe for you to do so, even if they'll die without your help, so to force women to care for fetuses is to hold people to higher standards for caring for the unborn than the born given how unsafe pregnancy is. I don't think it's a woman's obligation to use her body to care for another human, and I see abortion as relinquishing motherhood and care in the same way that adopting out a born human does. (Not comparable to the killing of a born human child, as there are less extreme alternatives that work there, unlike for the unborn) The fetus's death is just a consequence, not a cold blooded killing. At least in the cases I've mentioned. I know there are other circumstances, but oppose them if you want, I just don't think abortion in and of itself should be viewed as killing.   That being said, the logic behind “consent to sex is consent to pregnancy” for pro-lifers is that pregnancy is a natural result of heterosexual sex, even if it isn’t the result every time. Though this is true, I still don't agree. If someone goes swimming and starts drowning, lifeguards are expected to save them despite the fact that drowning is an outcome of their decision to swim. Paramedics still treat a car accident victim who chose to drive, rehab facilities exist for those who chose to do drugs and got addicted, etc. Consequences do exist, but generally we try to minimize them and fix the damage rather than pin it on the victim of the consequences for the choice that they made. as you said, the consent to sex isn't what makes it right or wrong, so I guess we can agree on that.","That being said, the logic behind “consent to sex is consent to pregnancy” for pro-lifers is that pregnancy is a natural result of heterosexual sex, even if it isn’t the result every time.

cg41ddn,EvolveSustain,"However, surely that shouldn’t mean that improvement in neighborhoods shouldn’t occur now if white people are among the advocates for it? Things can indeed feel pretty hopeless if that’s where the rhetoric takes you. This isn't what I heard in Spike Lee's quotations at all. Yes, the language was racially charged, but the argument revolved around respect for existing communities and the cultural practices/norms in place.  There were brothers playing motherfuckin’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud . . .  You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now shit gotta change because you’re here? To me, this is a legitimate concern that goes beyond ""bettering"" the community. Whose idea of improvement should be placated to? When you have different cultures occupying the same spaces, difficulties come up that have nothing to do with the measurable qualities the author talks about: those of property values and taxes, school quality, environmental concerns and policing. Yes, these things are a major concern, but it goes deeper than that, which I think the author skims over when he quotes a question about ""'social ownership' of the neighborhood."" Take ideas of [politeness]( for example, which seemed to have contributed to racial issues in LA during the 90s, specifically between Asian shopkeepers and African American residents. Asian shopkeepers felt it more polite to not impede on others, to maintain distance brevity and formality in interactions (what is known as negative face in linguistic anthropology). On the other hand, for African American residents, these actions and reactions were regarded as rude and impolite. Residents tried to act with, and expected, positive politeness (or positive face), where interactions are hoped to breed a sense of familiarity and individuals express pleasure and affirmations of the other or what they are doing. So go back to Spike Lee's quote about whites moving in and complaining about African drumming in Mount Morris Park. Taking a positive face view of politeness, the polite thing for new residents to do would have been to express admiration for the practice that long-standing residents had in place for 40 years. If new residents had known and wanted to be positively polite, they might have even joined others in the park for these regular events and integrated themselves into the existing community as admiring and friendly newcomers. Instead, what seems to have happened is the new residents brought expectations of negative politeness. I can't even argue that they brought expectations of wanting to maintain negative face because if so, they would not have wanted to impede on other residents traditions and freedoms. It seems new residents near Mount Morris Park felt the drumming was rude because it was intrusive. The drumming impeded on the freedoms of those non-participatory residents to enjoy some quiet and peace in their homes. Tl;dr - Problems with gentrification have to do with unspoken cultural conflict and (lack of?) consideration as much as it does economic and sustainability issues. These can be much harder to identify and address.",The drumming impeded on the freedoms of those non-participatory residents to enjoy some quiet and peace in their homes.

hd1ynzj,Egalitarianism,"Interestingly enough, violence is not ""bad"" though. There is no black and white ""good"" and ""bad"". Violence is expensive and causes a lot of suffering, spread among all involved in it.. which makes it a very poor choice a vast majority of the time. However there are also circumstances where violence as an option is preferable to the suffering that would occur were it not employed. Most notably, violence remains the only known foundation to conflict resolution in human society. When used responsibly this acts as a last resort: police (ideally not corrupt ones) defending society against violent criminals, tacitly coercing compliance from less violent offenders, wars between national armies to redress grievances that every other means have failed to redress, etc. However in the past our legal system was far more coarse grained and every trifling offense could not be arbitrated by outside parties. ""Honor"" was also viewed as a vulnerable asset to be violently defended, and still remains so in many less developed parts of the world today (inner city gang violence being a fine example).

Now, the approach you mentioned regarding the ""international level down"" or ""top-down"" approach is usually implemented to create standards that must be followed by all states and the communities and subjects within them. Note that this only works to an extent, because the manifestation of those standards will necessarily vary in reason of the sociological, economical and cultural context. Take for example the right to health, defined in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the following terms: ""The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health"". The core content of this right, the standard the Covenant refers to, is not delimited to be implemented in a single way, and so, it must be further developed by States and individuals in a way that respects that standard. Now, it could happen that the way a community or group is implementing this right is so brilliant that it might be generally adopted as a good practice, but those remain a largely voluntary act.

The charge of ""fascist"" gets bandied about a lot (erroneously) so I'll define what it actually means. Where do your rights come from? The liberal side holds that your rights are inalienable. You have human rights because you are a human, and the state is just sort of ""executive management"" to make sure those rights are upheld. The fascist side holds that your rights *come from* the state. You exist because they allow it, and your life belongs to them. That's what fascism actually is fascism holds that the authority of the state is absolute. A vaccine passport is a permission note from the state allowing you to live a normal life. Therefore it follows that they think they have the right to take that away in the first instance. They've already made the switch to the fascistic way of doing things, at least as their mental origin point, and vaccine passports are them putting that into practice. If they think they have the authority to implement vaccine passports, then what they are saying is that *they own you*. Some people might be OK with that. They've already got the double jab, and so are not fussed. But here's the thing; do you think it'll stop there? If we accept the premise that it is within the legitimate power of government to make you jump through a hoop in order to just live a normal life, why can't they make you jump through another, and another? What if there's a change of government, or a change in social attitudes, and people start having passports denied for other reasons? Maybe they're gay, for example. People who cheer for segregation need to learn that the fence they want erected is a moving target, and history has shown it is inevitable that sooner or later they end up on the wrong side of it. Whether you're vaccinated or not is besides the point. That's a medical decision and I'm not a doctor it's entirely up to you what you want to do, but do not get the passport. Acceptance is tacit agreement.","The charge of ""fascist"" gets bandied about a lot (erroneously) so I'll define what it actually means. Where do your rights come from?

ju0wl5r,antiwar,"Just look at the last NDAA passes by Congress, if you’re unfamiliar with how US politics work I’ll help you out. All spending bills originate in the House of Representatives, and as of Jan 2023 that was taken by the Republicans. The Dems passed a couple last min spending measures right before losing office and Biden has a few billion left from the original spending bill to play with, but support for this war in the US has fallen off a cliff. Members of the Freedom Caucus like MTG have promised not to send another dollar to this war. The next two years will see almost no additional Ukraine spending and if you think Biden wants this mess in its current state when he runs in 2024 you’re not paying attention. Our own Defense Department admitted the shortage to CNN a couple weeks ago and you’re wrong on the cluster munitions. “But officials say the US has been nearing that red line as it has continued to supply Ukraine with 155mm ammunition, the NATO standard used for artillery rounds. The US began ramping up ammunition production last year when it became clear that the war would drag on far longer than anticipated. But the ammunition will still take “years” to mass produce to acceptable levels, National Security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN Sunday. The US decided to send cluster munitions to Ukraine to help alleviate a potential shortage in the meantime, providing Kyiv with a supply of American weapons that haven’t been tapped into so far. But because cluster munitions can pose a long term risk to civilians, their transfer to Ukraine is only intended to be a stopgap measure until more unitary rounds can be produced, officials said.”  When even warmongers like the CNN and our own Pentagon admit there’s a shortage things aren’t good. They wouldn’t publish anything critical of the war until a few months ago and that’s not a coincidence either, stories like this will continue to drip into the public until the inevitable withdrawal. Americans have short attention spans and they’re over this war, low on ammo, and our politicians will never trade reelection for some bombed out parcels of land. If Ukraine could fight without relying on others for support they might have a chance but it’s too late for that.","Americans have short attention spans and they’re over this war, low on ammo, and our politicians will never trade reelection for some bombed out parcels of land.

Could you give me any evidence to support the war being planned in advance? I haven't read anything of the sort and I would actually like to see it. >Okay so the Danzig invasion was justified, pay no attention to the Poles also living in Danzig. And surely, if the allies had ""just"" given Danzig, Hitler would've been appeased. Germany's claim on Danzig was not rooted in nonsense, it was a territory arbitrarily carved out. Does that justify the invasion of poland? No, but it provides important historical context. The Allies factored little into Hitler's territorial ambitions, which were all rooted in the East and laid out well beforehand in Nazi speeches and ideology. Spouting ""appeasement doesn't work because Hitler"" blatantly ignores the nuance of the situation in Europe in the 1930s. It's nothing more than a buzzword. Saddam had no plans to invade anyone other than Kuwait in '91 because of the explicit territorial and debt disputes, but it was a common point of rhetoric about ""appeasement"". The only time supposed ""appeasement"" was ever 'attempted' was in the Second World War, and it's really not a good example of any policy. >So what you're saying is if Poland invaded Germany to take Danzig, an ethnically majority German city. But didn't want to annex all of Germany, that would've made everything okay? I-, what? Huh? Poland invading Germany to take Danzig? The fuck? >Also, how does Russia invading Georgia not in any way form a damning pattern of behavior when the then invade Ukraine? Following the war, Russian troops immediately withdrew and did not seize any territory not already owned by the states that declared independence in the '90s. Georgia's borders are the same as they were in 1993. This is completely different to Ukraine and also is under totally different circumstances. Two examples isn't ""a damning pattern of behavior"". The U.S. invasions of Grenada and Panama weren't a pattern proving that the U.S. would invade Iraq in 2003, each resulted from the unique historical circumstances. Countries aren't people, you can't point at a couple things and say ""this proves they wanted to do this"". >Russia literally sent arms and troops into Georgia in the early 90s, just like they did in Moldova. The troops in Moldova were told to pull out and they ignored the order, joining the Pridnestrovian troops in '91, not to mention the arms had been there since WW2. Not just that, the conflict started before the USSR even collapsed. Did the Russians have a pick in the conflict? Yes, but they did not forment the actual ethnic conflict itself, which began in the 1920s and flared up significantly in the late 1980s. >Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova. Chechnya - declared unilateral independence, was invaded, won the war, and then aligned insurgents invaded Russia later. Georgia - Abkhazians demanded their own republic in 1989, were denied, Georgian SSR authorities began to change policies, caused conflict. War started in 1992 over Georgian elections, Russia supports them in '93. War flares up again in '08, Russia continues to support rebels, status quo maintained. Moldova - Ethnic Russians split off in '91 to rejoin USSR after Moldova declares independence. War spills over into 1992, they declare independence instead. Russia orders troops withdraw, they refuse and support said ethnic Russians. Conflict frozen since '93. >Also, saying that Ukraine shouldn't count is absolutely baffling and idiotic.

jr2vy9x,antiwar,"> The war was started because islamic extremists moved into dagestan and declared a holy war. Before you try to claim this was fabricated, here is the source from the UK Indepentent, who also spoke against the moscow apartment block bombings. The bombings were used to drum up public support of the war, not to justify the war itself. You're citing a contemporary article that is obviously missing the context of decades of new evidence. Since then we now know (not suspect, **know**) the second chechyen war was planned *in advance of* the bombings. The bombings were conducted by the FSB to justify turning a local anti-terrorism operation in Dagestan into an invasion to solidify popular support of the president and PM. > Danzig in 1939 actually was, by all intents and purposes, completely under the control of the local Nazi party and when it was annexed incredibly supportive of it. Okay so the Danzig invasion was justified, pay no attention to the Poles also living in Danzig. And surely, if the allies had ""just"" given Danzig, Hitler would've been appeased. > The key difference here is that the Nazis in 1939 went on annex the entirety of Poland, where Russia has not annexed any region in Georgia whatsoever and only has supported the local de facto governments. Said de facto local governments had already declared independence far earlier in ethnic conflicts in the 1990s So what you're saying is if Poland invaded Germany to take Danzig, an ethnically majority German city. But didn't want to annex all of Germany, that would've made everything okay? No, sorry, don't buy it. Also, how does Russia invading Georgia not in any way form a damning pattern of behavior when the then invade Ukraine? > Georgia had not been fomented by Russia whatsoever Russia literally sent arms and troops into Georgia in the early 90s, just like they did in Moldova. > The only way you could possibly construe the modern Russian Federation as having imperialist ambitions is if you look at Ukraine. Nowhere else has Russia attempted to annex a region or invade and seize foreign territory without provocation. Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova. Also, saying that Ukraine shouldn't count is absolutely baffling and idiotic. Of course Ukraine is clear and present evidence Russia has always had imperialist ambitions. The only difference between now and then is that they used to show restraint to avoid antagonizing the west. But decided they didn't care for pretense anymore in 2022.

Fences break, things at these places are often poorly maintained. It's obvious that the first thing the circus owner will do is blame the activists.

Being aborted before they're born is preferable 2: A certain portion of the male chicks do serve a purpose in keeping an orderly hierarchy in free range chickens. As for the rest, see #1, even the shredder isn't that inhumane in my eyes. 3: I'm not eating the dairy cows. My purchases of organic free range milks ensures these cows have a good life before they're taken off to the slaughter. 4: What the fuck? 5: In the US this is a good point. Here in Europe, specifically the Netherlands we got strict labels that ensure the organic animal products are ethical. IN CONCLUSION. These arguments won't turn me vegan. If the producers can ensure these animals live a worthwhile live then I'm all game. It's also why I don't have much issue with organic meat eaters (I personally don't like the idea but on ethical grounds there's very little problems). I do have a problem with vegans themselves do. Not with being preachy, as a vegetarian I get that ad hominem often enough, don't worry. I have a problem with vegans because they stare themselves blind on the killing aspect of the animals. The slaughter is a short procedure compared to the whole life of an animal. Vegetarians and organic meat eaters are contributing towards better conditions for animals because they're the ones putting their money into this. They're financing the better conditions for animals to live in. Conditions that are by far preferable to wild conditions of an animal. This means we're actually increasing the well-being of animals. Vegans don't do anything about it. Yes you lower the demand for meat. But you're not discriminating between ethical and unethical treatment, you're treating it all as the same, and because of that you hold now sway in the animal market.

There is increasingly a movement to pasture animals and raise them on their natural foods. What percentage of farmed animals in your country do you think are *not* fed farmed food? You know, I can equally say that there are increasing movements to establish local organic food co-ops to minimise the environmental footprint of farmed food. If you're so keen to tout the best-case for farmed animals, you should be comparing it to the best-case for farmed grains/legumes/veggies. Whether we are looking at best-case for vegan vs. omnivorous consumption, or average-case or worst-case -- *if* we're making a fair comparison, the impact of the vegan diet will come out on top. The reasons differ depending on whether we're looking at best-case or average-case or worst-case. For the realistic current best-case farming of animals, we need to sum the impact of water consumption, land usage (and the subsequent displacement of other species), methane output, transport, and the suffering caused to the animals in the best-case of existing farming practices. The sum of these doesn't look pretty next to the impact of the standard best-case organic farming practices for a vegan diet. The gap widens if we compare average-case to average-case, which on the omnivore's side of things is factory farmed animals fed the cheapest farmed food. On the other hand, if we're making an unfair comparison (e.g. best case omnivorous consumption vs worst case vegan consumption), obviously we can make whichever diet we like come out on top. It's a meaningless comparison because it doesn't address the ethical question an individual faces, and nor does it address the question of the average case if we're looking at realistic large-scale impacts at the population level.

j958dta,ADHDers,"I have a to-do list that works really well for me (when tasks have real deadlines), but it’s like I become blind to the tasks that don’t have real, tangible urgency. This reminded me: (1) The Adult ADHD Tool Kit (2015; it's based on CBT and the authors have solid credentials) has some strategies, but I've forgotten them... One of them was to specify for how long   when exactly in your day you will be doing the task   put it in your Daily Planner (that's where you are supposed to schedule/'budget' the 24h of your whole day - that's right, the authors use the budgeting metaphor for planning your day)... 'Enter The Room With A Plan"" (make plans for what you will do in particular spaces) and ""Turn on the device with a plan"" (make plans for your behavior on your devices) was some other stuff... That book has LOTS of strategies though... (2) 4:00-9:01 from [this bit]( of Dr Russell Barkley' lecture (he is a prominent ADHD specialist) has some strategies too. With diagrams! :) // I used to have Calendar reminders set for it, to rewatch it every 2 weeks *(because ""Out of sight, out of mind"" applies even to ADHD management strategies, as I've learned; I need to review them regularly to remember(!) that I have ADHD and remember those strategies).* Then stopped.

j9648ka,ADHDers,"Time blocking isn’t effective for me because I have a very unpredictable schedule (which I can’t do much about for various personal reasons). So even if I schedule, say, portfolio work for two hours tomorrow, something urgent and important could come up (I take care of an ill family member, so say for instance they call me with something i can’t ignore which happens often) that I need to take care of then and there. Those two hours will never be the most urgent thing on my to-do list because there are so many time-sensitive and unpredictable tasks on my mind and in my path. So, they will just be pushed back for something else consistently. To be clear, I’m not pushing these non-urgent tasks back consciously. I become unaware the task exists because my memory only keeps urgent things at the front of my mind — and there’ll always be urgent things. I’m sorry that I don’t know how to explain it any more clearly than that because it feels like such an abstract concept. But let’s say that the two hours aren’t interrupted and I *could* work on those two hours of portfolio work. I just won’t. It’s easy to say “well, just do it” but as anyone with ADHD knows, that’s not how it works for most of us. If we could “just do it” or work the way NT people do, it wouldn’t be classified as a disorder. It feels like I’m watching my body do something other than it’s told. My mind is screaming at me to do the portfolio work, but my brain is in the wrong body so the body doesn’t do what it’s told. It does something else instead: something urgent, challenging, pressuring, exciting, adrenaline-inducing. So unless someone offered me a whole lot of money to make ten portfolio pieces by X date, or threatened to repossess my house or whatever, that portfolio work will never induce enough adrenaline for me to even consciously register “hey, this needs to be done”. Part of the issue is the living in the moment problem many ADHDers have. When I’m living in the moment, non-urgent tasks don’t exist to me. It’s only when I take the time to stop and reflect (like now), I can intellectually understand why this problem exists and that those tasks exist. - - - Yeah, like you said, I’ll also just snooze things on my calendar until I become blind to them. I’m not even conscious of the fact I’m doing it! Also, portfolio work in this case means creating paintings that reflect the style and work I want to be hired for. I really enjoy painting and can get into some serious flow with it, so I know the enjoyment isn’t the issue. I’ll easily get started on a commission because that feels urgent since I need to deliver to be paid and create a return customer, but portfolio work just doesn’t feel that way at all. I understand its importance, but the lack of urgency causes me to just keep putting it off unintentionally. In my to-do list, it isn’t just “portfolio work” written. I’ve broken it into small projects which are broken down into smaller tasks like “create Pinterest inspiration board”, “create ten thumbnails for ideas”, that sort of thing. So I’m not sure being poorly defined is my problem. I have a decent project management system set up that works for me, and all my tasks go straight there and get broken down into small sub tasks. So I don’t struggle with the overwhelm of getting started like I did in the past. My current problem isn’t the getting started, but just knowing the task exists. Even when I check my to-do list, calendar, and so on, it’s like I’m blind to the task. I’m really struggling to articulate it. Thanks for taking the time to offer your thoughts!","It’s easy to say “well, just do it” but as anyone with ADHD knows, that’s not how it works for most of us.

kcsspcw,israelexposed,">There is no apartheid. Arab Israelis are equal citizens. The comprehensive report, Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity, sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law. This system is maintained by violations which Amnesty International found to constitute apartheid as a crime against humanity, as defined in the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention. Source:  Laws, policies, and statements by leading Israeli officials make plain that the objective of maintaining Jewish Israeli control over demographics, political power, and land has long guided government policy. In pursuit of this goal, authorities have dispossessed, confined, forcibly separated, and subjugated Palestinians by virtue of their identity to varying degrees of intensity. In certain areas, as described in this report, these deprivations are so severe that they amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution. Source:  A former head of the Mossad intelligence agency has said Israel is imposing a form of apartheid on the Palestinians, joining a growing number of prominent Israelis to compare the occupation of the West Bank to South Africa’s defunct system of racial oppression.  There is overwhelming evidence that the system instituted by the Israeli government against the Palestinian people meets the UN definition of apartheid. In effect, Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory constitute one territorial unit under full Israeli control. Palestinians constitute around half of the total population (inside Israel and in the oPt), yet under Israeli law, and in practice, Jewish Israelis and Palestinians are treated differently in almost every aspect of life: housing, education, health, employment, family life, residence, and freedom of movement. Dozens of Israeli laws and policies institutionalise this prevailing system of racial discrimination and domination.  There is 100% apartheid. To deny this is to support it. And to support it is to be a despicable human being. Maybe you should stop lying to yourself and believing those lies, or stop letting your shitty government lie to you. Wake the fuck up and realize you've been supporting apartheid, genocide and ethnic cleansing.

Two years ago when I tried to find a therapist and they sent me home with a ton of anti-psychotics and a social worker...I actually went for marriage counseling. The only reason I was sitting in that chair was due to my marriage hitting a heavy bump. My husband went to a separate therapist at the same time in the same building. When I left with all the scripts, and a recommend for a social worker, he was at first baffled and then very angry. He asked me if they ever even asked about our marriage issues. I said no, they asked about my childhood. He ripped up the prescriptions right there and said we weren't going back. For the record, I think psychiatrists start doing drugs after hearing about what I have survived. They just assume I want to also. I have moved beyond my time in hell, quite well considering, but unfortunately it follows me everywhere, because I was a serious cutter. I have a lot of very visible scars from those days over 15 years ago. This gives people excuses to make judgments about me, even though I haven't cut in over 10 years.

c2fk9cr,troubledteens,Bla ok so in the time I posted the last comment I have done some research. First don't take this the wrong way I really really appreciate the hard work you and others have put in. But CAFETY seems to be going about this very inefficiently. I do not think increasing the statues of limitations is politically feasible. Also using a website to randomly solicit people to go through state laws is pointless. They need to call up some law schools and find students doing required probono work to do that. They are way more qualified and putting that request as the second way to help confuses people and scares people off. Laws like HR911 seem like a much better target. Unfortunately efforts in that direction have stalled. Here is my suggestion. First contact the cosigners of HR911 and ask exactly why the bill died in the senate and who is responsible. Once you know who is responsible find out witch one of those people is politicly the most vulnerable. The next call is to the direct political opponents of those responsible. Let them know that they can use this information to keep those people from being re-elected. Finally start a campaign along the lines of donate x money and we will put up an ad that says y supported child abuse by keeping HR911 or similar laws from coming to a vote. Or put together little protests at those candidates events. If there are not enough resources to hit these candidates the next target are more local people. Find out what judges/prosecutors are stopping criminal cases from going forward and use similar tactics against them. At the local level even very small amounts of resources go a long way in influencing politics. Petitions are the wrong approach. They have very little influence on politics(except for ballot initiatives). The only thing really influential is hitting political campaigns. You have to go after small specific targets as hard as possible. Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Wouldn't you say?

I feel that the OP has left out the actions that caused her to be placed inside of isolation. WWASP has no oversight, no venue to punish its torturers despite 1000s of complaints of torture offered to every branch of govt. Your feeling that an organization that has no laws binding it, that engages in human trafficking and torture is going to put someone in isolation only for ""reasonable reasons"" is idiotic, and, most likely is supported because you are a shill.

PLE refers to any intentional migration of WNs to establish a white settlement. Have you never been on Stormfront?  First of all, we don't yet need to openly discriminate. No matter how subtle you are, they'll eventually find you out. I don't agree with masking our beliefs to appease others. It doesn't sit right with me. We'd still have to silently sit by and watch as any area we move to is ""diversified"". Then what? Move again?  When shit hits the fan, and if we do it right, there will be a large number of likeminded whites ready to help each other and rebuild a nation. I don't think the shit will ever really hit the fan though. I think we'll slowly fade into the background like has happened in Latin American states with historically large populations of whites. We'll continue to be marginalized and just grumble anonymously about it until we're in a situation like South Africa. The Afrikaners will be overwhelmed when their government comes for them eventually. The numbers will just be too great. Same story with any PLEs in America. Nothing major will happen until we're too few in numbers to defend ourselves.  I don't see the US being even capable of cracking down on something like this to begin with simply because the government is going to start crumbling from the inside pretty soon. The government won't come down on us until we're no longer the majority. And when they do the liberal whites will cheer it on, the moderate whites won't care, and the conservative whites will wash their hands of us. No international action, no revolution, nothing. People will put down their guns instead of getting killed over their beliefs. They'll sell out their fellow WNs to stay out of prison. They'll give up their cause to not lose their jobs. Very very few of us are full on idealists who are willing to stand our ground. Not nearly enough to mount a defense. It'll just be a new Ruby Ridge scenario every day for years until people give up.  Besides, the faster white flight happens in all of these places, the faster the economies crumble, and the faster we'll see the US end and a white ethnostate begin. A white ethnostate won't happen while the US military still exists. We'd have to have a complete and total destruction of the entire system *before* doing anything.

c95o1oq,Egalitarianism,"What society are we referring to? Because the society that glorified general male characteristics, the familial structure and looking up to the head male figure is essentially gone. The family structure is butchered; what's left of it has a mishmash of forms, some patriarchal, but not nearly enough to consider it a societal standard, and males are absolutely no longer seen as primary decision-makers. It's literally the common stereotype that a male's girlfriend / wife has all the power, and he's more or less a servant now. Unless you want to go to a few select southern towns. The idealized male despite still having disproportionate weight over females and other males is no longer considered the image of males in general. It's a tiny segment who have disproportionate aggression that other people cannot stand up to and so they get ahead. However, this has nothing to do with patriarchy since for the most part this is considered an aspect of single younger males, or older business males; not really an aspect of a settled down married life. And in fact this cannot be considered a system males in general are the primary icons of. The average male in this system is compared to an unreachable standard which if it is not achieved more often than not the average female is considered a higher social unit than them (at younger ages) and bears disproportionate power in older ones. (though there are obvious exceptions and certain systems of poor culture where the general culture does not apply, obviously.) In fact the system seems to imply general female control of social interaction with the successful males now being considered the ones who rise above the norm. Not the other way around. Either way, there's one problem. These ""alpha males"" as they are called... biology dictates that they are the ones that males and females both will capitulate to. So if all the issue people have eventually boils back down to disliking them... well their position is not merely cultural. It's biologically ingrained in all people. So it's not going to be changed by people supposedly evening the playing field since this statistical forms of enhanced characteristics are still what makes everyone else let them get ahead. In an even field this would still happen. And males (who are in tune with reality) dislike this more than anyone since it means in social life they will generally not be respected unless they comply with the ideal of the ones who surpassed females. Where as females have a bit more leeway for space. (In the direct light that is. Doesn't mean antisocial males don't dislike them behind the scenes.) Of course that is only one aspect of society, not all of them. It is different in others, like the direct business world, where females are seen as less qualified in some aspects of it. (though similar, since again this often relates to the peak efficiency being held above everyone else system.) The truth is that the way to solve these issues is not based in sex but rather EMOTIONAL restructuring. Aggression, pushiness, and acting on emotion need to become more discredited as far as modes of action in general before we will see any change. Since that will make people more likely to find those aggressive alpha males not worthy of the respect they are given. And more disgust at their selfishness will be had. The problem is that modern feminist movements are actually causing their own problems by glorifying their own emotions. And since emotions are a two sided coin that causes males to glorify male emotions as well. (since they are the same emotions more or less) And so it perpetuates the system.",And more disgust at their selfishness will be had.

jy83ecl,prochoice,"I think I have to disagree with you. Most people, regardless of their stance on abortion, don't want to physically torture women or children, and often have good reasons for holding their beliefs such as wanting women to have bodily autonomy, or valuing human life in every stage, and by understanding where their beliefs stem from, it can be easier to get them to change their views. While I agree that there are pro-lifers who only pretend to care about females to draw them to their movement, I would not say that all pro-choicers care about women either. A good example of such a person could be a man that uses women for sex, who only supports abortion because he thinks it could let him get away from having to pay child support if one of the women he sleeps with gets pregnant. With that said, you mentioned being childfree, and a potential pregnancy being a form of torture for you. Have you considered getting your tubes tied? That way, you would not have to worry about getting pregnant, regardless of whether abortion is permitted where you live or not. After all, even if terminating a pregnancy is legal there, it can still be an unpleasant and costly procedure, and unlike a tubal ligation, it might have to be repeated multiple times.","While I agree that there are pro-lifers who only pretend to care about females to draw them to their movement, I would not say that all pro-choicers care about women either.

fwhsocv,prochoice,"I disagree with that, pregnancy is one of the issues but once the child is born it's 18 years minimum of financial, educational and emotional responsability. And that has a real life impact on people's mental and physical health, on their life plans, on what they can and cannot do, the difficulties of having a child dont just stop at birth. It has even more of an impact on the child. Why is neglecting the childs needs and removing their rights an acceptable answer to an adult's problems?   Why should we force men to be responsible for a child they didn't want in the first place if we don't force women to do so? If a woman has a child and decides she doesn't want it anymore she has no more or less right to abandon them than the father does. In pregnancy, there is no child to abandon. If you have an abortion there is no child whose needs will be neglected by the choice to ""opt-out"" of parenting.   I am not saying a guy can opt out whenever he wants, I am saying that he should be able to do so at the same time a woman decides whether or not she aborts. So during the first ~6-24 weeks of pregnancy a man can sign away rights and responsibilities to a child that doesn't exist yet? Or do you mean post-birth? Either way, when a woman aborts there is no eventual child who has a right to support but in these ""financial abortions"" there actually is a child who doesn't cease to exist because you don't want them.   People should decide what to do in case of a pregnancy before having sex but we know that most people don't and that's as much on men as on women. It's actually not. Pregnancy has far more impact on the person who's pregnant so it's biologically more on her than it is on him. It's her choice what she does with her body during pregnancy. It's not the mans right to decide what happens if she gets pregnant because it's not his body. It's as much on him to participate in deciding whether or not to have sex, using contraceptives, and raising a child as it is on her but the ""if she gets pregnant"" question is her's to decide and she can change her mind whenever she pleases.   We should. I understand that in todays reality the financial, educational and emotional responsability I was talking about before is in the vast majority of cases put on the woman, and that has to change, but if we say parenting has to be equally distributed between genders then the choice to be a parent should be too. So in order for men to be expected to take care of children they father they should have the option to abandon said children, too? That's not putting the expectation on them that they'll participate equally in parenting at all. Regardless, once the childs born it's not mother's womb vs fathers finances, it's childs needs vs fathers desires. Why is the solution to the so-called inequality of women having the right to control their own bodies and men not getting a say in their medical care to remove the right to support from a third party?   But forcing an unprepared young man, a financially unstable man, a man with mental health issues or simply a man who doesn't want a child to be a father is in my opinion not the way to go, because we would be doing to them what they're doing to us. Again, it's not men vs women when we're discussing parental responsibilities because the responsibility is not to the other parent but to the child. You don't get even with your co-parent by neglecting a child.   because we would be doing to them what they're doing to us. I wholly resent the idea that making a person spend money is at all the same as making someone go through pregnancy. That's ridiculous. I also resent the idea that giving women rights over their bodies has to be equaled out by giving men a new right as well. Something being fair and something being right are not the same things. Biology is unfair. The equalizer, if you must find one, is that women who choose to go through with a pregnancy have to be pregnant and give birth, and women who don't have to be pregnant have to go through as much of the pregnancy as her access to abortion dictates and then also go through an abortion procedure. It's not paperwork, it's our bodies.",People should decide what to do in case of a pregnancy before having sex but we know that most people don't and that's as much on men as on women.

c3tqbd6,evolutionReddit,"I presuppose that its not the government's job to tell a person what to do. The question of civic and moral duty is a personal one. In terms of licensing of airwaves, its not the government's job to dictate what a person should or shouldn't broadcast. This is where you need to be careful with calls of civic duty and moral trust. In places like Burma, the government does hold people to a moral and civic duty. In the name of national peace and security, you end up with censorship of the media. I'm not trying to strawman, its just at broader level, you can't try to censor someone just because you disagree with them. We can't as a group demand they respect free speech when a piracy bill pops up and then fight free speech when its against our interests. There's no question that CU has done damage. But one free speech grounds it may be correct. There are other ways we can tackle the issue. You can use the same civic duty and public trust arguments to get Google, Wikipedia and Reddit to start self censoring their user generated content. Back to licensing airwaves. The public return from selling rights to those airwaves is in the price we charge, which we convert into schools, hospitals, science etc etc. If we failed to get a fair return on those airwaves, then its a negotiation problem. And it doesn't surprise a libertarian when government regulators screw up.

c4l74wt,evolutionReddit,"And the idea that freedom of speech should be the first principle, is not some new cypto-techno-libertarian idea. Our Republic protected freedom of speech under the first amendment. Before all others. Because freedom of speech is the foundation of free and open society. Yes to a degree. However JFK's euphemisms, even though right and noble, are no longer credible for today's media corporations (i.e. the press) attempts to ""inform"". If you look up the chain of conglomerates that finance the majority of news companies, the biases and censorship become more evident. The television era went by so quickly, that it was difficult for most players to keep up. The ""money makers"" beat us to the chase first, replacing any euphemism of critical media which once may've recruited dialectical and critical thought, into a mere passive pleasure for the masses. Essentially an exchange of rights and freedoms for some form of convenient pleasure, dare I say Soma. I for one can't sit through television anymore. Advertisements, vacuous television shows, celebrity constructed narratives, and news channels that always need to remind me they are ""real news now!"" With the introduction of the internet these money making corporations, primarily the media corporations, were not impressed with its nature. A contributive and collaborative system of media? Creativity with no costs? No consumption? We can flip some pages forward into the future and find ourselves opening up the US Digital Millennium Act. The internet, even now with an influx of media corporatism (banner ads, youtube commercials, data-mining, etc.) did not waver. Some of us users were smarter, using plugins, scripts, add-ons, all to avoid the corporate infection and to retreat into the pure internet we once knew. There are other motivating powers and reasons for why the internet is becoming censored (a quick read through 1984 can even provide some imagination). However, media corporations have always needed a way to get their consumers *to* consume.   I just worry, while I agree the internet is a new social entity. The independent internet is yet to realize its economic and political strength... and we have almost zero military or diplomatic power. The declaration of independence will need to wait until we have more power. Its rare for anyone to give up power willingly, we will probably need to force the issue. I suspect we need to wait for a true meshnet to evolve before we can really begin considering independence. I feel you hit that one right on the nail. In some ways the internet has failed to recognize itself as a power of discourse, culture, maybe even hegemony. It has a strange sense of governance that is so human, and can be analyzed from so many vantages. One day we may probably even have courses in school teaching subjects about different topics on the internet (""Jungian and post-modern ecology 4chan"" would be a funny one). Censorship will not work. It will most likely lead to many cat-and-mouse scenarios. However considering where the US is heading, and its extensive diplomatic power across borders, things do not look positive. Perhaps the internet doesn't need a body of laws, but in a way, some basic rights. However how can we construct basic rights for a cyber-society when we can't even follow properly, or avoid violating, the rights we have today in our own societies?","It will most likely lead to many cat-and-mouse scenarios.

A 2017 article (1) ""Can direct democracy offer a third way to meet the climate challenge?"" refers to the prevalent lethargy of governments (we could add, commonly corruption).

To be more effective, it must be possible for citizens’ proposals to go legally binding ballot of the whole electorate. r r An example with citizen-initiated referendum.r r Nowadays in Germany several Lands (regions of the federation) have quite user-friendly direct democracy which enables citizens to propose or veto laws, to force parliaments to debate law proposals, and to call a ballot of the whole electorate which causes the government to change course. Across the country several pro-environmental proposals have been put forward in this way. For example, recently in Bavaria (not known for hippies and freaky environmentalists) there has been a highly successful citizens’ initiative, presented in the form of a draft law, aiming to regulate agriculture and protect countryside nature (Dubbed ""Bee initiative"" but much broader).r r The INIREF campaign proposes the introduction of citizen-initiated referendum at all levels of government in the UK and our countries.

If he had done the human thing and taken righteous revenge on the DNC and pushed for Bernie supporters to go Green and H lost, you would see Bernie and his ideas go the way of Nader.

Any candidate in 2020 with a similar platform to Bernie/Stein/Nader would again be marginalized. It will be a better outcome if we elect lefty politicians as Ds to the point where we take over the party from the banker Ds or have enough established lefties in office to warrant a new party or a mass exodus to the Greens.

These two ideas will help make the case for supporting a 3rd party, even if it means a conservative gets elected this term. This is a legitimate fear for a most people, and unless we can make a solid case and advertise it well, only the most angry progressive voters will consider voting Green. Secondly, we must concede that until the day comes when we have enough progressives in the legislature to write voting reform and correct our two party system, elections are not just about spreading good ideas.

gr3oyww,VeganActivism,"This reminds me of reducetarianism. Is it good people are eating less animals / supporting less animal use? Of course. Is it effective for us to set this as an end goal? IMHO no, and the [research supports that we should advocate for clear end goals]( (and focus on the ethics) Similarly if non-vegans want to talk about vegan issues, that has the potential to be a net positive. (Peter Singer self identifies as a 'flexible vegan' and has said, ""That is, I'm vegan when it's not too difficult to be vegan, but I'm not rigid about this, if I'm traveling for example."" Has he inspired many to live vegan through Animal Liberation and other contributions? Sure. Would he have had more of an impact he sent a consistent (non-dietary) message? Undoubtably. However as animal advocates, I think we should focus on advocates who walk the walk and send a morally consistent message. After all, is someone who can't even be bothered to live vegan likely to be a sustainable /longterm activist? Probably not. Preventing burnout is hard enough for those who are vegan. So similar to how if we advocate for a clear end goal some non-vegans will still reduce (and reduce 'more' according to the research), I think we should advocate for activists to be vegan, and non-vegan animal advocates will still likely do what they were going to do anyway, and probably be more likely to live vegan as a result. (Of course we should be mindful about how we advocate to them as with anyone, make them feel welcome if they attend events while empowering them to live vegan) *As a note, I've noticed animal 'welfare' brought up on this thread. I think it's a crucial point of confusion in the movement that this advocacy is a net positive. In my view, this is a complete distraction and further entrenches animal use and human superiority, by suggesting there's a 'right way to do the wrong thing.'

But PDs sometimes leave to become private attorneys. It happens.

You'll also be around a lot of other attorneys you can learn from and model yourself after. So yeah, lots of people become PDs to gain the experience necessary to open up shop. Although I would be wary about it being enough, honestly. In lots of jurisdictions, you're just not going to be able to make a living just handling criminal cases. And the PDs office isn't going to train you in anything civil. That said, you'll probably get the baseline skills necessary to figure out other similar-ish areas of law, like family law for instance. You'll know how to question witnesses, etc. But, you also see plenty of private attorneys trying to become PDs. You have the security of a salary, so you don't have to worry about running a business, finding clients, etc. I have no interest in running a business and trying to convince people to hire me. I just want to try cases. And that's all I get in this gig. The clients come to me, even though it's an overwhelming number of cases.

People charged with those offenses usually can't afford an attorney, and lots of private attorneys are hesitant to take those cases because they are very time-consuming.

Its depressing to watch educators who I thought were passionate about equity in education lose their minds about the risks of re opening from watching too much CNN or whatever. My district sent out a Thought Exchange survey about reopening. In this, participants could write anonymous comments about what you think is most important to consider for school re openings, then rate others' thoughts vased on how significant you think they are on a scale of 1-5 (similar to upvoting on Reddit). About half the comments were how we need to stay online indefinitely, and that the state and APA guidelines are ""unsafe"" vs. those who think schools need to re open (suddenly they do not trust the ""experts?"") Many say theyre not comfortable coming back.

gkxr707,LockdownSkepticism,"Excellent piece - something very similar was going to be the topic of my next essay, so you saved me the trouble of writing it! As time moves on, I find myself leaning far more towards blaming the compliance of our population, than the overreach of our Government. Governments are nearly always lustful for greater powers, it is the lack of consent of the people which should keep this in check. The Neil Ferguson Times interview may contributed heavily to this feeling:  “I think people’s sense of what is possible in terms of control changed quite dramatically between January and March,” Professor Ferguson says. When SAGE observed the “innovative intervention” out of China, of locking entire communities down and not permitting them to leave their homes, they initially presumed it would not be an available option in a liberal Western democracy:     It’s a communist one party state, we said. We couldn’t get away with it in Europe, we thought... and then Italy did it. And we realised we could. To think that such discussions were had behind closed doors, and to picture the smile on the face of the authoritarian when he realised that public resistance was so weak... sickens me. The next question is why. Why was our generation so uniquely ready to cast off our rights and freedoms so easily, on such a weak justification? I have a few new ideas on this question, which I will try to formalise over the next few days.","And we realised we could.

glf09ea,LockdownSkepticism,"(Warning: long comment ahead) This is one of the most interesting things I've seen from looking through the UK zero covid website - they really and truly are quite similar to us, we just disagree on whether or not covid can actually be eliminated (I would say no because viruses can stay stored in the human body for long periods of time - see the research about the cold virus outbreak in Antarctica after a long period of isolation - and also because it is zoonotic and has already been shown to spread to animals from humans. Not to mention how much community transmission there has already been, the fact that parts of society will have to remain open no matter what, etc). Looking at Zero Covid UK's [Founding Statement]( here's what I see:  **Stronger measures**    Stronger measures are urgently needed to reverse the rapid rise in infections. A full lockdown would quickly reduce community transmission close to zero. This would grant desperately needed time to – at last – replace the discredited private test and trace system with one based locally: on council, NHS and public health structures, recruiting contact tracers locally. This infrastructure will be needed even after Covid, because pandemics are becoming more frequent, driven by wanton destruction of our ecosystems. Ok, not surprising, they want ""stronger measures"", whatever that means. Local track and trace systems seem a lot more efficient though, I'll give them that.  **Individual freedoms**    What about individual freedoms? Suppressing the pandemic means empowering communities and individuals to act safely, look after each other and regain our freedom faster. Zero Covid is not about repressing the people and forcing us to live forever under strict controls. Quite the opposite. The pandemic will be over far sooner with a Zero Covid Strategy than with the government’s drawn-out, on-off approach. Hmm... When I first read this, I was like: *what exactly does this mean?* That if we Zero Covid the UK asap, then we get our individual freedoms back? Or does this potentially - gasp - imply a personal responsibility approach like Sweden? But this is where things get interesting:  **Social solidarity**    Instead of crude police enforcement – which disproportionately targets black and Asian people, young people, and those in precarious work, on benefits and in overcrowded housing – there should be collective discipline and social solidarity, with financial support, clear messages and information, free masks and sanitiser and community groups funded by councils to support the at-risk, the sick and the lonely. This is what I've been arguing about for a long time - the enforcement of lockdowns has a disproportionate effect on people of colour and working-class individuals. The policing of restrictions only really benefits white middle and upper-class people who can afford to work from home, and in my experience looking at my white friends (doomers but hypocritical ones), they have no fear flouting these rules because they subconsciously know the rules don't really apply to them much. I think this could be a really important point of agreement between us and the zero-covid folks. The rest of what they have to say is interesting too - a lot of reimbursing people for the detriment that government responses has on their lives, i.e. making the government take responsibility for their own policies. No more ""stay home for free, help the NHS"", more like ""stay home, we'll pay you"". (The Safe Workspaces part though may be slightly controversial here):  Only workplaces with Covid Safe certification should be allowed to open. Their arguments:  **Safe workplaces**    Where key workers can’t avoid going to work despite the virus, the government should coordinate investment to make workplaces safe, with extra space, equipment, ventilation and staff. Workers and their trade unions should be fully involved in ensuring safe working conditions in line with the [Covid-19 Safe Workplace Charter]( Only workplaces with Covid Safe certification should be allowed to open.    **100% of wages and compensation for the self-employed**    All workplaces that are not absolutely essential should close during the lockdown. The state must fully compensate workers, including the self-employed, for loss of earnings due to measures taken to suppress the pandemic.    Wherever workers are off sick, isolating, shielding, not working due to caring responsibilities, can’t work safely, or lose work due to the pandemic or action to control it, the government should guarantee 100 percent of their wages. Where workers are made redundant, benefits should be increased and made available immediately. And no one should be homeless during this pandemic: the ban on evictions must be extended indefinitely.    **Extra resources for those in need and at risk**    Extra resources are needed for disabled people, black people, Asians, other minorities and people in poverty.    With state schools closed, families need to be given all the resources enjoyed by better-off families whose kids attend private schools: laptops, cameras and the very best distance learning tools. The last point on the page is also controversial, however, I also see people here say that closing borders would have been a much better approach than lockdown:  **Reduced international travel**    During lockdown, international travel should be reduced to an absolute minimum. Once we have reduced infection levels that can be managed by the new FTTIS system, all arrivals to the UK should be screened for the virus and quarantined if necessary. If this process is made clear before people embark on international travel, they will be able to decide for themselves if they still want to go ahead with their plans. This part, again, screams ""personal responsibility"" to me:  If this process is made clear before people embark on international travel, they will be able to decide for themselves if they still want to go ahead with their plans. And they said ""screened for virus and quarantined if necessary"" - that doesn't actually imply mandatory quarantines ""just in case"" people have the virus, rather, why don't we actually test people and see if they have the virus, then let people live their goddamn life if they don't! Maybe I am too optimistic, but part of me thinks that the Zero Covid people are perhaps the most likely people we can get on our side, **because they are already critical of the government + the effect the interventions have had on people** and **because it looks like they have already considered solutions that are alternative to the current lockdown implementation.** They are probably more likely to support the idea of mutual aid groups and individuals helping each other out, and I am guessing that they are less likely to support the government's claim that infections are rising ""because of a few people - a small minority but still a bad enemy - flouting the restrictions"". Sorry for the long comment, I had actually considered making a full post about this in the sub earlier this week. However, just been thinking, maybe this is a possibility we could discuss more on this sub? Join hands with the ""enemy"" haha, may or may not work, though I guess both they and us have the same opponent: the government.","This part, again, screams ""personal responsibility"" to me:  If this process is made clear before people embark on international travel, they will be able to decide for themselves if they still want to go ahead with their plans.

It is simply a false equivalence.) -Vaccines do not eliminate transmission, thus do not stop Covid or justify a mandate. The supposed medical benefit of vaccine passports do not stand up to scrutiny; as a result, they make life harder for many and sow unnecessary division for little to no pay off. -QR codes necessary for shops and cultural spaces are inherently discriminatory and classist. With the necessity of a smart phone, we are effectively barring from society anyone who cannot afford a thousand dollar phone and a monthly fee of $100. (Even if one were to say, “Lolz, print it out,” that would require access to a computer and a printer, both of which are expensive and, with vaccine passports, are unaccessible in public space, so a bit of a Catch-22, that.) -Medical and religious exemptions are not being honored or are hampered by unreasonable burdens, thus infringe upon religious liberty and physical well-being. -MRNA vaccines have not undergone long term testing, testing on pregnant or nursing women, testing on people with certain allergies, or testing on people who may experience drug interactions. -Medical coercion is not informed consent. Denying someone the right to a livelihood (*especially* in non-medical settings) is not providing a choice. Furthermore, people who suffer adverse reactions from forced vaccinations have no legal recourse. -And perhaps slightly less significantly, vaccine passports have not led to the alleviation of isolating and demeaning “health measures”, so once again, life is not improving post-vaccinations and very unsurprisingly, governments (and businesses) are only tightening their chokehold of society. In fact, some of the most vaccinated populations are accompanied by the harshest health restrictions. -Vaccine passports also contribute to a collectivist society that erases the autonomy of the individual- sometimes even demanding they risk their lives- for random, anonymous people. I don’t care if it’s selfish. If you’re not my children, friends, or relatives, no, I do not care more about you than myself and my kin.

You are using FEMINIST STATISTICS to claim women do stuff, despite FBI statistics proving they don't. - There are several definitions for various purposes but the thing all officials seem to agree on is that it is important to *not* count people who are shot but don't die in the definition of a mass shooting. However large a mass of people are shot the incident is not a ""mass shooting"" unless the required three or four people also die. The FBI required four deaths excluding the shooter. Recently this has been reduced to three, to match the CRS and some other definitions. Regardless, the ""I don't like Mondays"" girl still does not make the grade. Various measures have exclusions for gang killings, parents executing their children, and killings as part of other criminal activity. Only relatively random killings and going postal at work or school are included. - Statista records 109 male and three female mass shooters from 1982 to Feb 2019.

Sexual Coercion: 96.3% male perpetrators Table 3.8: Sexual coercion experienced by male victims, 81.6% female perp only  The ""MADE TO PENETRATE"" had 92.5% male perpetrators only. 1.7 million men have been victims of ""made to penetrate""...looks like the perpetrators of male rape are OTHER MEN. You are disregarding the fact that a majority of men who are raped are done so in PRISON by other MEN. MEN are the problem. Except that's not what the actual report says. Try reading it. Table 3.5: 1.715m men raped by being made to penetrate *in the last 12 months*, compared to Table 3.1: 1.473m women raped by penetration *in the last 12 months*. Yes, more men were raped than women in the study period. And again, this study would only have partially captured prison rape, since men currently incarcerated would not have been surveyed. Finally, of men raped by M2P, 78.5% were raped by female perps only, 3.5% by both male and female (Table 3.8).  Men also do not make up a ""majority of the victims"". According to your source: there is an estimated 22 million female victims of rape between 2010-2012. There is an estimated 4.2 million male victims of rape (with a majority of perpetrators being OTHER MEN). Nope. Please refer to the above. 1.715m male rape victims   1.473m female rape victims in the 12 months preceding the survey. It's literally in black and white right in front of you. The 22m figure of women raped in table 3.1 is an estimate of **lifetime** victimization, which is notoriously inaccurate in women, and has no validity for male victimization, particular given the impossibility of external validation by comparing to historical data because thanks to bigoted trash like Mary Koss the study of men as victims was intentionally suppressed.  You should PROBABLY learn how to correctly read and analyze data before you play your big victim card with the oh so oppressed male in society. Well given that you've yet to be able to read a single statistic, table, or figure from the report correctly....I'm gonna have to ask you to practice what you preach. Bonus: [In a study of adolescents, by age 18 females were 48% of those admitting to perpetrating rape]( rep=rep1 type=pdf)  Oh...can you show me some data where little boys are kidnapped systemically and forced into sexual slavery in the modern era? I'd LOVE some sources to back that up. Not only are they trafficked for sexual purposes, but boys and men are also frequently trafficked as slaves for forced labor, or enslaved as soldiers.  In 2016, a Department of Justice-commissioned study, Youth Involvement in the Sex Trade, found that boys make up about 36% of children caught up in the U.S. sex industry (about 60% are female and less than 5% are transgender males and females).  In 2008, researchers from the John Jay School of Criminal Justice reported that boys account for about 45% of child trafficking victims in New York City.  In 2013, an ECPAT-USA report concluded that the “scope of (the commercial sexual exploitation of boys) is vastly under reported.” The researchers also cited the need to better identify male victims, to raise awareness about the harm caused by commercial exploitation and to provide more services designed specifically for boys. [I also recommend looking at CTDC's data](  Oh yes it isn't men abandoning a baby in a dumpster, it's just men systemically abandoning their families and creating a huge fatherlessness epidemic because of their inability to take responsibility. Thanks for admitting it's women who do the baby dumping. But you may want to look at who actually abandons families and if you want to focus on fatherlessness - look at who initiates divorces and excludes fathers from access to their children.  Not to forget that a MAJORITY of cases of CHILD RAPE are PERPETRATED BY MEN. A MAJORITY of cases of CHILD MURDER are perpetrated by MEN. A MAJORITY of cases of CHILD ABUSE are perpetrated by MEN. [Boy are more likely to be abused.]( [Boys make up~35% of child sex abuse victims]( and 40% of the people abusing those boys are women. Most child murder is done by mothers. Here's one study over 10 years with [79 female perps, 45 male]( Further, from   The risk of homicide is particularly high for boys, who account for 70% of all child homicides and for whom homicide rates dramatically increase in late adolescence  Data from 33 countries distinguishing the perpetrators of parental homicides of children under the age of 18 years showed that mothers committed just over half of all parental homicides Intersting what you find when you look at the data. Your entitled to you're own feelings, but not your own facts Kellyanne  Need not forget the temperance movement was started because men would get drunk, come home, and beat their wives and children. Lol no, you clearly have never read anything at all on temperance after failing 7th grade social studies. This was primarily a religious movement that had nothing to do with abuse at all - the religious gestalt was that drunkenness was a sin. Some do argue this as the emergence of modern women's movements, largely due to the perception of women as more spiritual or pure and thus empowered to address the sins or social ills of their society. In any case, their primary enemy was the seller of alcohol who they saw as getting rich of the suffering of the poor: who would drink through their pay, embarrass their families, and not *gasp* slave away for their wives. Interestingly this is the same reason victorian women protested coffeehouses (lol).

They sided with the fact that the newspaper had sufficient evidence to run the abuse story on Depp and therefore the judge sided with the newspaper that it was not defamation. 2. It was not a ruling against a man proving ""male privilege"" doesn't exist in courts as so many of you love to say. The person who won the case, the owner of the newspaper, is a male. A male did in fact win this case so stop screaming bias verdict when both parties actually involved in the trial were male 3. Amber is clearly not innocent in of this but it was not her who decided go sue the newspaper and air the dirty laundry. When Depp decided to sue he knew the newspaper would have to provide evidence to their claims, he knew they would call up heard and other witnesses, he knew it would be a huge news story, and he knew if he lost it would essentially be ""proof"" he hit Amber. So everyone crying about how unfair it is that its all being aired out in the media and his career will be ruined need to stop blaming heard for that and start blaming Johnny lol.

gu46qo8,HerpesCureResearch,"1. How has HSV affected my life (Personally, mentally, socially)? If HSV didn’t affect my life tremendously, I wouldn’t even be here in this group, or desperately googling for answers to a potential cure for hsv. Ever since diagnosed with Hsv2 3 years ago, my life just stood still, literally. It was the first time I heard of the existence of herpes, as my schooling days didn’t teach us at all about STDs (coming from a very conservative Asian country, Singapore). What makes hsv so traumatic is that it lives in me for the whole of my lifetime and it really does affect my social life tremendously! I became distanced from friends and family, even though they know of my condition. It’s EXTREMELY HARD to relate everyday life to them as I’m different, I have a virus in me that I have no control of. I can’t do anything about it. I feel like a walking dead every single day 💀 I’ve been to counselling, countless sessions of psychotherapy...still, I feel so empty inside as I just feel I belong to another world (people with herpes) and not of this world. It’s this traumatising and emotionally distressing 😭😭😭 And not to mention, that amount of shame and guilt that I have to carry every single day every time I wake up, it’s such a huge burden!!!!! I never asked for herpes, but because of an irresponsible act of a human being not disclosing to me/ being ignorant of his health, that’s how I got it. I need a way out, I feel hopeless im this world, but hsv did taught me a lesson: to not have casual unprotected sex anymore. But as a Christian, I still pray everyday to God for hope and a potential cure, so that I can move on in life with a peace of mind, not carrying the burden of herpes, not having the need to disclose to potential boyfriends (that anxiety is crazy, honestly no one wishes to have that kind of worrying thoughts: how I should disclose etc). Please relieve me of that burden. 2. What would better treatment or a cure mean for me? Knowing that there’s a cure for hsv2 would mean the world to me!! Now I’m constantly protecting my family, friends and boyfriend from contracting it from me, crazy thoughts like they could get it from sharing food with me or cup etc. A cure would take all these anxieties and crazy thoughts from me. I no longer have to worry being infectious, it would basically bring me back to life, to humanity, to where I was before (just a decent human being longing for a simple life). My mind wouldn’t be so distracted with hsv, and I could focus on making wise decisions in life. Life is already so complicated and difficult, I do not need hsv to lose my focus in life. We only have 1 life to live, and I wish to make it fruitful, having meaningful social connections with people I love and care about, not constantly worrying about how will people react if they know I have hsv (which isn’t my fault in the first place). Social connections with people and stranger s are what matters to me, I don’t wanna feel or be isolated anymore. To know that Fred Hutch and his team are working hard to come up with a functional and sterilizing cure is such a huge relief! It’s a blessing seriously, from God. He’s heard my prayers, He’s answered them. I pray that you guys can succeed in creating a cure for hsv, once and for all, it’ll mean a lot to millions of people in this world who simply didn’t ask for herpes and is desperate for just one simple hope every single day, that is to be cured. Thank you for listening ❤️ Christina, 30, Singapore","It’s EXTREMELY HARD to relate everyday life to them as I’m different, I have a virus in me that I have no control of.

h9467re,Intactivism,"This is my response to them and I even blasted them on my FB campaign page where I am trying to get equal protections for ALL children: I'm an intactivist that has a campaign trying to get all children equal protections. The reason some intactivist don't is that there are so many out there already fighting against FGM and it's almost universally frowned upon by the majority of society. I have asked many fighting FGM to help with the fight of MGM and they have outright refused and yelled at me for even comparing them. I have had people come I to my discussions about circumcision/ MGM telling me I need to shut up and fight against FGM because it's worse. When society fights to justify what's done to you and dismisses your pain and harm it can be a little aggrevating and hard to want to fight for anyone else. My campaign primarily focuses on MGM and IGM, but also believes FGM needs to be absolute abolished as well. It also is very telling when you have currently 39 states and the federal government having laws that exclusively protect girls from all cutting including religious and cultural, but none for boys or intersex children. There is a clause in the Constitution called the equal protections clause which basically states that no law can be made which denies equal protection based on race, religion, sex and so on. Yet these FGM laws violate this and no one wants to listen to us about them. The latest federal law was a bill sponsored by Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas called the STOP FGM bill and signed into law on January 5th 2021 by Trump, why couldn't the law have been neutral? As stated before I have asked for help to fight for the equal protection of all children and the moment I mention that includes banning routine infant circumcision people stop listening. I am someone who often has to deal with physical pain and damage still to my body because of this surgery I never needed. People tell me I need to shut up and stop whining. I am often banned from forums because of telling my experiences. My physical problems from circumcision can not be fixed yet society just dismisses me as botched to justify circumcision as still necessary. I have been blocked by FGM activists because I have asked them the reverse of what you are asking intactivists. People accused me of derailing when I was suggesting fighting all together. I have seen FGM victims support MGM and tell me there can never be any comparison. It's difficult to want to fight for people like that who act like they are the only victims. Again this is why I believe many intactivists don't try and help, it's not that they do not agree it should be stopped, it's that their pain get dismissed and treated as unimportant by those who should understand. My campaign is called Campaign to end child genital mutilation. I have tried reaching out to politicians, media personalities and news organizations with no responses. It does pretty much deter you from wanting to help. Edit: their response and mine to their response    ","I have seen FGM victims support MGM and tell me there can never be any comparison.

Many women who grew up in cultures where FGM is the norm might say the same thing about FGM, while horrified at the idea of MGM.

I would say that the majority of Americans think this way, so singling out feminists is strange and unproductive. Focus more on how you can convince them; trying to immediately say that you consider FGM and MGM equally bad may be honest, but it won’t get you anywhere. Empathize with the issue of FGM, and bring up the similarities and how it can impact men. Otherwise, since they are starting the conversation with the belief that MGM isn’t as bad, they may feel like the comparison is minimizing the horrors of FGM, which will feel like an attack.

f8ttquy,Vegetarianism,"Hey, I really feel this cause my first few attempts going vegetarian were huge failures. I didn't understand my body's own needs and ended up making myself sick. Here are some things I learned that made it easier. 1. Mock meats aren't great every day. They can be really helpful during transition and often contain more protein than the regular meat dishes, but I find that they're best saved as treat meals. 2. Animals can't produce their own protein, so what we get from them is not only fewer but lower quality. It's best to skip the middle man. Beans are nice, but if you're like me and not a big fan, there are still plenty of plants that can meet your needs. 3. Plants are more suited to your digestive tract, so you'll digest them easier. You may want to start eating extra meals to fight off hunger. This is a great opportunity to introduce more color into your diet to ensure you get all the vitamins you need. 4. Everyone should get regular blood tests regardless of diet. If there still seems to be a problem you can schedule an appointment to check for deficiencies or other conditions that may be making you feel tired. I hope this helps, but honestly, you shouldn't beat yourself up regardless. It's hard to do what you want to when you live with others who don't understand.

I think you could call militias military and that could fit antifa maybe? Idk - basically no leftie is anti male, this is a strawman from the right.

It's complete and total nonsense.

People recognized something: when two Europeans of different countries would have children, those children would generally not feel they were distinct from each other. Thus, they would create a society that was free from identity politics. Their children wouldn't feel seperate from the broad society, and thus such a society wouldn't be riven by different identity groups. As the progressive pioneer Teddy Roosevelt said, ""There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americans."" That's what it all comes down to. A nation can only exist if people feel they have something in common. If they don't, if it's a collection of different groups who feel no particular connection with each other, or hostility to each other, the politics and society will break down into competing tribes. Various demagogues will play one group off against each other to protect their own power and wealth.

It can function as long as there is a strong central authority to bind these schisms together, but it never lasts forever. That's what America has become. What is America today? What unites it? What is the 'tie that binds' America today? Other than a desire to make money, an interest in corporate entertainment - movies and and TV and video games - and a desire to buy things?

Even people as hawkish as Kissinger and as integral to American cold war policy as George Kennan were saying decades ago that NATO expansion to Ukraine would lead to disaster. \- Zelensky campaigned on a peace/de-escalation platform with the Donbas - it seems indicative of how embedded Neo-Nazi/far right elements are in Ukrainian government and military that he has not done that and has even come out with statements in support of Stepan Bandera. \-We agree that the people of Ukraine have a right to decide it's future - free from Putin but also NATO's - Victoria Nuland famously getting caught discussing who the United States would work to get into Ukrainian office being an example of that. \- For the Crimea I think it's very fair to be critical of the annexation, although that seems to be done out of the desire to secure the Sevastopol naval base which ties back into the reaction to NATO expansion. As for the Donbas, they seemed to want more autonomy from Kyiv but were driven to more separatist leanings by the reaction from the military- think that becomes more a national question/self -determination question rather than a question of Russia annexation. Agree Putin's speech about Ukrainian independence right before the invasion was bad and deserving of the criticism it's gotten. \- It's fair to want it to be written Kyiv, ya. I think we want the same conclusion (an end to the invasion in Ukraine and a sovereign Ukraine/no war with Russia) but I don't think that happens without guarantees against Ukraine inclusion into NATO, and some sort of reaffirmation of the Minsk agreements in the Donbas.

Your mortgage payment has increased nearly $1000 this past year; that's at a mortgage principal amount of $600k, which is modest for new home purchases in populated areas these days (i.e. Van, Toronto, Montreal, etc). How can you charge ""affordable"" rent? And what's affordable? It's not housing! You need to be moving into an apartment complex or lower income housing for affordable. What also is defined as affordable. The government of Canada, the provinces and all municipalities boast they want to promote it, but continue to leave it an open term and block all chances of achieving it. Another example, a lot of cities are making the creation of multi-family dwellings near impossible to get permitted (affordable housing) and I'm cases where they are, the development fees per unit (not including construction or permits) are upwards of 50k CAD per unit. That gets mortgaged by the owner on top of the actual building fees. Scenario 2 is to build a garden suite/carriage house/detached dwelling unit which (for an 800 sq ft apartment) costs $350k.

If you have a strong case and are able to present it cogently to plaintiffs' attorneys, you will be able to retain a better attorney. There shouldn't be a consultation fee. You may be asked to pay a retainer, but that can be negotiated. If you win/settle, obviously the attorney/firm will take a cut, but the retainer will be credited to you from the award/settlement. The specifics will be laid out in your agreement with the firm when you retain them. it's a fair amount of work, but certainly not as much as a day job, or picking the wrong attorney.

iej287n,Dyslexia,"As others have pointed out, there are a lot of statistics, some good and some bad. I guess it really depends on which ones you want to focus on. What I can tell you from my own experience is that it took me along time to understand my dyslexia and to be okay with it, but after I did it really did became a blessing. I am fortunate enough to have had challenges and advantages in life, in a proper balance to make me resilient and also give me the opportunities I needed to succeed, I think this makes the biggest difference in peoples life and weights a lot more than dyslexia or anything else. Even with dyslexia I was able to graduate college, get a job in and succeed in one of the top tech companies in the world, and now i have my own business and make a profit even during the pandemic.

There's a lot here, you're feeling a lot, and I think talking it out with someone who can both guide and challenge you would be helpful. Definitely is for me. Finding an ADHDer therapist, especially adult diagnosis ADHD, would do a world of wonder for you. Past that I will say, there's genuinely a lot of grief that comes with this process of being diagnosed and going through life knowing you have it. For me I was so sad and depressed for the little kid I was, and for the kid and adult I felt I could have been if things had been different; I still am sad for that. Why didn't my teachers know, or my mom, or why didn't I get help just because I could hyperfocus on books and worksheets? Would I have been less depressed if someone stopped and helped me understand why I was different from other kids? Ultimately I just say, be gentle to yourself; don't overload on ADHD doom scrolling and self diagnosis stuff; and focus on concrete strategies for concrete problems, like getting multiple bins for laundry rather than having piles. Much love to you friend ❤️","Definitely is for me. Finding an ADHDer therapist, especially adult diagnosis ADHD, would do a world of wonder for you.

h0uitfv,VeganActivism,"I feel the same and want to do more. here are my tips: Stick up posters of what so called humane slaughter looks like.

Mini ones for the meat aisle, huge ones for the street. Vary the style, font etc. Go to different locations, protect yourself from being recognised. look at brandalism.ch for ideas on guerrilla tactics eg replacing ads at bus stops/ on the train etc. replacing tube ads is very low risk as no cctv on many tube lines, google it. check local laws so you know whether or not to do certain things... put images onto banners and release into supermarket aisles attached to helium balloons. add weights to the bottom of the banner to make sure the banner rises high enough that nobody can remove it without a ladder, but low enough that everyone can see your message and images. rob banks' instagram has videos of him wheatpasting up posters. you can make wheatpaste at home and it's hard to remove posters stuck up using it. in person activism and spreading images of the truth is a low effort high outcome method. crimethinc and other sites have info on direct activism techniques (blockades etc and more low risk options like what i've outlined) let's show up and get shit done for the animals  3  3",you can make wheatpaste at home and it's hard to remove posters stuck up using it. in person activism and spreading images of the truth is a low effort high outcome method. crimethinc and other sites have info on direct activism techniques (blockades etc and more low risk options like what i've outlined) let's show up and get shit done for the animals  3  3,Intention,RedditExtension,Participation

fjtfpx8,FeMRADebates,"So perhaps you could offer some examples of compassionate and kind feminists like you acting on such convictions? EDIT: Because I know a lot of examples of self-identified feminists acknowledge that the failure to address those problems, or indeed, even acknowledge that these problems exist in the feminist movement is at least a substantial part of the reason why so many people are anti-feminist in their outlook, not the nebulous all-pervasive evil demon you call ""the patriarchy"", yet words are cheap, and what are any of you doing about this, given the institutional power you have at this point? And here's a quote from one of them:  There is a lot to like about this piece. Penny correctly points out that women have an extra layer of marginalization on top of what Aaronson went through, and that Aaronson didn’t account for that in his comment.    However, I think the thing that rubbed me wrong about Penny’s piece is that she didn’t offer any account of the role that feminism played in Aaronson’s tortured adolescence, which is an experience unique to the privileged, and which Penny didn’t acknowledge at all. [...]    Penny claims the mantle of feminism, yet she refuses to acknowledge the role that her movement played in Aaronson’s tragic story. She demands that Aaronson, as a nerdy white man, be “held to account” for the lack of women in STEM, yet refuses his call that feminism be held to account for its at-worst abusive and at-best unkind rhetoric toward people deemed “privileged.”    The thesis of Penny’s piece is that as a nerdy woman, she went through all of the hell that Aaronson did, plus extra because she’s a woman. I think if she wanted to make that claim, she should have some kind of argument that Aaronson’s unique pain somehow doesn’t count or is somehow lesser than the pain of being a woman. I don’t find that obvious, and I don’t think she even attempted to make a case for it.    I think, as feminist advocates, we are obligated to recognize the darker side of our community and its potential to cause real-world harm. Aaronson’s piece was a real, raw testimonial documenting some of that harm. Penny’s piece just seemed like she was trying to handwave it away. She was compassionate, but she ultimately didn’t seem like she was listening.    I tend to recognize this because it’s a problem I have often — when someone tells me about an issue they have, I try to relate it to my own experience. On the one hand, a measure of that is how empathy/sympathy works. But on the other hand, I have a tendency to ignore the differences that make the other person’s pain and loss unique. I feel like that may be what’s going on here. The rest of the story is here: ","So perhaps you could offer some examples of compassionate and kind feminists like you acting on such convictions?

If you aren't interested in penetrative sex, then that is fine and you don't have to do that, but it has nothing to do with your actual sexuality, just like people all across the spectrum of sexuality are not interested in certain sexual acts.

Do you reject the validity of sexual orientation?  Again, nobody is saying you have to do anything, it's just that you have to realize that someone's genitals does not affect your ability to have a wonderful relationship with them and does not even affect your ability to have that relationship be of a sexual nature.

it33ddz,ADHDers,"It's similar to alcohol! Alcoholism is real and severe, but not everyone who drinks alcohol is addicted. Some people have a bunch of glasses of wine or a glass of some spirit every dinner, such as my grandpa. He'd have a glass or two of Raki, a Turkish spirit, diluted with water every night at dinner. He also was not an alcoholic! He very much could go without drinking for days with no hindrance, and he never had the urge to do more. He just drank it because he enjoyed it. Last part might not be entirely applicable to us (it certainly is a necessity for me and doesn't feel great all the time even if I love the ability to focus) but there are parallels. An example of resistance would be my father (my family is an interesting bunch). He has an incredible alcohol tolerance! Saw him drink the equivalent of a bottle of wine, and then drive home with no signs of alcohol influence. He can handle a lot, and it doesn't phase him much at all. This doesn't mean he couldn't become an alcoholic however. He's not one now, thankfully, but if he drank several bottles of wine every day, he would still develop a dependence. Combined with his naturally high tolerance, he'd also need a lot more alcohol to get him drunk, and increasingly more as he developed an even higher tolerance. If you take the relevant aspects of both of these stories, we aren't too dissimilar to them. We also take them often, but aren't addicted. We also have higher tolerances for them, but doesn't mean we can't get addicted. We can just do it often in a safe manner without it affecting us negatively.

ioqnrc1,ADHDers,"I probably have a different perspective here because I was raised in a Christian cult that didn't allow us to celebrate birthdays. I only got to celebrate my first birthday last year. So I never grew up with that expectation and cannot 100% relate to what the average person expects when it comes to birthdays. that being said, I would imagine most reasonable people would understand if you forget a date. Even a birthday or anniversary, they're simply numbers. It can be hard to remember numbers for many of us. Do you love your partner any less because you forgot these particular numbers on this particular day? Of course not. Im sure he knows that. Don't beat yourself up. The love you show every day is the most important thing. Again I can't fully understand the cultural significance of remembering birthdays since I never experienced it and dont see it as a big deal in general for that reason. At the same time what I do know is that the love you and your partner share is not defined by a certain set of actions on a certain numbered day. Take it easy on yourself. Im sure your partner would not want you to beat up on someone he loves and cares about, right? You're the someone. If you guys were walking down the street together and someone came up to him, and started calling him an asshole and a POS, would you be cool with that? You'd probably want to protect him, right? Treat yourself the way you imagine you would treat him in that situation. Step between yourself and the ""abusive person"". Tell them, No you can't talk to this person I love this way! Maybe the best gift you can give him now is the gift of kindness and understanding to the person he loves and has chosen to be in a relationship with. Kindness ourselves is, in fact, kindness to our loved ones as well. Try not to beat yourself up anymore. Maybe jot down all that you did this time to remember and then next time, you can examine what did and didn't work and adjust accordingly. It's okay. I promise. You are not a POS, you are a human being. If you were really an asshole you DEFINITELY would NOT be here right now, venting to all of us about how bad you feel! that's your proof right there. :)",Again I can't fully understand the cultural significance of remembering birthdays since I never experienced it and dont see it as a big deal in general for that reason.

hg0isdf,troubledteens,"These programs usually have a group leader plus 3 or so assistants per group. Most have more, especially when they are training new staff. The staff are generally paid minimum wage (or slightly above minimum wage). These programs justifies low wages because they are providing food and shelter to their employees while working. The participants are not prisoners, but I understand why you would use that term. The primitive conditions students endure (sleeping under tarps instead of tents, carrying gear on a homemade frame, not a pack, the monotonous, cheap and improperly prepared food that's common in these camps would 'encourage' one to use that term. From what I understand, these programs are considered 'staff secure'. The students do not have access to maps. Some programs blindfold students as they are transported to and from the current campsite of the group they are about to join, which is highly disorienting--and a form of abuse. (Only on rare occasions are civilian prisoners blindfolded--and not in the United States--it is generally considered inhumane treatment.) Students are not allowed access to maps, directions or compasses--which increases disorientation and dependence on a group of strangers. These programs are considered staff secure because, when in camp, staff removes boots, stores them and guards them. They rely on the fact that walking barefoot in wilderness conditions is slow going and very painful. They require that the students mostly likely to run away sleep within arm's length of staff and that staff be aware of the location of all students at all times when awake. Even though these programs generally do not have awake overnight staff (a requirement for programs housed in buildings to be considered staff secure), the precautions taken to hinder runaways is considered to be the equivalent of 'staff secure'. From what I understand, the trip leaders probably do carry a cell phone or a satellite phone. They have a predetermined itinerary, where the group will meet mental health staff, gain or loose participants, get resupplied and swap out staff. (Many wilderness programs run on a two week cycle of 8 work days, 6 days off.) What happens if a participant runs away? Nearly all facilities I've examined require that students wear a uniform that includes at least one brightly colored item that stands out in the environment they are hiking in. This makes it easier to locate the student. What happens depends on the facility and its policies. In a 'gentler' program, if a walkaway happens during the daylight hours and is quickly realized, many programs will have a staffer, probably more, try to stay within eye contact of the runaway and rely on the fact that the runaway does not know where the roads, houses, towns or potential sources of help are. Most programs will sic the biggest, baddest staffer on you, tackle you, take you to the ground (and maybe do more than that). Some programs store items, especially a piece of underwear, at their basecamp in Ziplock style bags, so that they can use tracker dogs to try to locate runaways staffers have lost touch with. Many programs make it clear to participants that if they run away, their parents will send them right back to this program, or send them to an even harsher one (like what happened in the UK version of Brat Camp, where a participant in Aspen Adventures was sent to the confirmed abusive program Turn-About Ranch). They will tell you, whether it is true or not, that your parents will not allow you to come home until you complete the program. If you are successful in reaching town, you'll stick out like a sore thumb. Cops will pick you up and eventually take you back to the program (after engaging in whatever 'fun' the yokel who probably knows someone who works there decides is appropriate.) If you try to communicate with your parents to try to let them know what is going on, how unsafe the conditions are, you will be silenced. Staff will read your mail. You will be punished for saying anything critical about the program. What happens if someone lags behind? In all likelihood, a staff member will be assigned to be with that person. The staffer will, in all likelihood, minimize the pain and distress the participant is in, will claim that the participant is being 'manipulative' even when the participant is clearly injured and/or ill. The staffer will probably beret the participant into continuing on, whether it is in the participant's best interest or not. There have been reported instances where students who were actually seriously physically ill did not get timely medical attention, had their complaints labelled as 'manipulative', had injuries worsen to the point that they would never heal properly or worse... death.","(Many wilderness programs run on a two week cycle of 8 work days, 6 days off.)

The Atlanta security guard became a Reddit hero, while taunting black thugs in language that would probably mae Zimmerman blush, and was rewarded with something like $20K in donations. Zimmerman, on the other hand, because he was not black, was derided as a racist and made out to be a white vigilante straight out of the Charles Bronson/Clint Eastwoood film genre.

evxr4bu,EndFPTP,"As for party lists, they are usually closed and when they're open the party still holds most of the cards so objections are hard to orchestrate. It's like giving the party leader a megaphone and then saying ""we didn't hear anyone object"". I get what you're saying, and agree to an extent, although my bigger concern is that since most open list systems are de-facto SNTV inside the party's seat allotment, any rebellion against the party's pre-chosen list is complicated by the additional need to coordinate to avoid losing seats. If it weren't for this coordination issue, though, I wouldn't really have a problem; after all, if enough voters couldn't be bothered to object to the party order, I have a hard time justifying overturning in regardless of the fact it makes it harder for legislators to step out of party line.  As a counterpoint, a lot of New Zealand voters split their vote, voting for a candidate from a different party. This tells me voters are willing to vote imaginatively and off-brand if the system supports it. Well, there are better reasons to ticket-split in MMP like in NZ, no? I mean, the first is obviously that the best candidate to look after your local interests is not necessarily going to be from your preferred party. The second is that MMP systems can be forced into de-facto MMM systems by aggressively running clone parties and splitting the votes there, as we've seen in systems around the world with decoy lists (basically, voting strategically to give your faction more seats).  I appreciate that voting for parties is easier, but it's also more easily manipulated and it's less democratic. Agreed, which is why I think it's important to make it easy to vote for candidates directly to the greatest degree possible, while *also* allowing for the voter to indicate a deference to prespecified rankings of other groups. I've elaborated on this before in r/EndFPTP but I'll do so again below since I'm fond of the idea.  There shouldn't be dozens of individual candidates IMO. Ireland had an average of 13 candidates per constituency. I'd want slightly more MPs per constituency so it would be more than that but not much more. To be honest, I don't see much of a way to avoid it if you want overall good proportionality since you need large district magnitudes, which in turn means more candidates. The good news, IMO, is that in countries like the US where we already have primary elections, they could be used in the future to reduce the number of candidates down to a tolerable number before the general election. Plus, I think fairly simple measures like elevated signature requirements would suffice to prevent at least Australian levels of ballot insanity (i.e. not every microparty needs to run a district magnitude's worth of candidates, nor should they be encouraged to do so). Anyhow, my thinking is this: the fundamental flaw of Australian GVT's was that they (1) limited the GVT submission to parties and (2) you could only vote for a GVT *or* rank all the candidates manually, but nothing in between. Ideally, IMO, any STV system should be expanded so that (A) GVT's (or the equivalent thereof) could be submitted by *any* group with a sufficient number of unique voter signatures, and (B) a voter can manually rank as many candidates as they please, and choose to either pick a GVT to complete any rankings they've left blank *or* choose to let their ballot exhaust after they finish their manual rankings. I think this is probably about what most voters are looking for; there's some candidates they'll really want over everyone else, so they manually rank those, and beyond that there's usually just a preference for some parties over others (which should be reflected in the GVT they select).","As a counterpoint, a lot of New Zealand voters split their vote, voting for a candidate from a different party.

gkfneyl,EndFPTP,"would give small parties a much better chance at taking those seats. I don't believe IRV would do that. It would just perpetuate the two-party system. It would be better in the sense that third parties don't cause an upset and elect the less-preferred of the two parties, but not in the sense of giving third parties a path to victory.   On the state level, which is what actually determines the election systems, third parties would become substantially more viable. I don't see why it would behave any differently on one level than another. Cities in the US use RCV and are still two-party dominated. Maine uses RCV and is still two-party dominated. The number of third party reps in Maine's legislatures have actually *dropped* [after adopting RCV](   Two municipalities voting for it doesn't really strongly evidence ""much more support"" than RCV, which was adopted by the entire state of Maine. I mean that Approval has passed with a landslide in 100% of the places it has been put on the ballot, while RCV has not. RCV was adopted in [Maine]( and [Alaska]( yes, but with much slimmer majorities, while being rejected in Massachusetts, etc. It's also been [repealed in a bunch of places]( after being adopted by slim majorities, too. Better voting systems are easier to sell to voters than mediocre ones.   I fail to see how STAR is less complicated than RCV. ""Elect the most-preferred of the two highest-approved candidates"" is simpler than ""Elect the candidate who has a majority of first-preference votes, unless none do, in which case eliminate the candidate with the least number of first-preference votes and repeat"". STAR is 2 rounds, precinct-summable, etc. IRV is multiple rounds, requires transporting physical ballots to a central location, etc. If you only pay attention to the ballots and voting process, and ignore the way they are tallied, then yes, they are about the same complexity, but STAR is still marginally simpler, because your ballot isn't invalidated if you give multiple candidates the same score or leave blanks.

gkg0ssx,EndFPTP,"There's a very important distinction between STV and IRV, ""surplus transfers,"" but you're close enough. So, this is a matter of some debate and there is pretty deep division on this subreddit about this point. I'll explain my position but know a lot of people disagree with me. There are many more multi-winner races in the country than single-winner ones. For every mayor, there are 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 city councilors. For every governor, SOS, AG, and auditor, there are hundreds of legislators. It's because of this fact that the tenor of our multi-winner races are far more relevant to the tenor of our national politics than our single-winner races are. It wasn't Obama that led to the rise of the Tea Party, it was congressional elections. If we change the way we elect our legislatures, we will change our politics. We will see different candidates for single-winner offices and different campaigns. If we adopted a better single-winner system for President, and we elected more consensus Presidential candidates, that would do nothing to fix the polarization and gerrymandering and utter broken state of the US Congress. And it's the broken state of the US Congress that is driving most of our political problems in this country, not the occupants of the White House. Even adopting the best single-winner system wouldn't address gerrymandering. For this reason, I value adopting a proportional system for multi-seat offices as much, much, much more effective for repairing our political institutions. It also just so happens that my favorite method of implementing PR in the US, for a variety of reasons, is STV (single transferable vote), which has an identical *ballot* to IRV. From a simplicty-to-the-voter standpoint, I like arguing for ranked ballots and adopting STV for multi-winner races and IRV for single-winner ones.","If we change the way we elect our legislatures, we will change our politics.

daa1opn,TwoXChromosomes,"You're missing the point and you skipped straight to the story involving my family and how I have a cousin who is just an unfit mother and a burden on those around her. Her own personal behavior has nothing to do with the point. I would appreciate it if you could provide a valid, non-biased argument to the points I made that do not regard my family and the one individual who should have been locked away in prison for 7 felonies. If you were a woman, you were raped and you know you're not ready to support a child, or if you find out from a doctor that your child will be born with an illness that will make their life impossible to live without constant pain and be still be completely reliant on medication and may only live to be 14 before it kills them, are you still willing to give birth to that child? Also, please don't say that women who are not in a sexual relationship should take birth control because of the chance of rape. I know there is a statistic out there that shows sexual assault is commonly performed by someone who has an established relation to an individual but there are scenarios where women are raped by people they do not want to have sex with, including being part of that statistic. What about if you have an 80% chance of killing both yourself as well as the child, due to a condition that you are likely unable to carry the pregnancy to term? Would you still take that risk? What if you combined the two? A 17 year old girl gets pregnant because of rape and her body is not fit to carry a baby to term and has a chance of dying? If that was you, would you still want to have the child? What if you just cannot afford the pain and cost of carrying a fetus to full term? There is help out there but you are being ""helped"", not supported 100%. Nobody will carry that baby to term for you. There are parents out there who cannot have children of their own, so they look to adopt. Its great that putting a child up for adoption is an option, but there are complications that involve the welfare and quality of life for children who grow up in foster homes and without their biological parents because there are just so many children born without the option for a better fit home. There are so many scenarios where abortion is arguably a better option than bringing a child into the world, why make a law that tells people whether they can or cannot give birth to a child, *especially* if you had never intended on becoming pregnant for any of the varying reasons. The argument saying you shouldn't snuff the life out of a fetus who would become a conscious, sentient homo-sapien is not much different to saying there is potential for billions more babies to be brought into this world, that by not having sex, we are denying their right to live... Which by the way, would be a very, very bad thing for human society and resources for humans to continue living on this planet. The world is not black and white. To say it is and to limit the choices of everyone over something that primarily affects them and the life of the fetus in their womb is a very selfish thing to do. If you have no personal reason to stand for the argument, why argue someone else's decision? I believe in keeping options open as much as possible for the scenarios we cannot foresee or for situations that someone may find themselves in.","You're missing the point and you skipped straight to the story involving my family and how I have a cousin who is just an unfit mother and a burden on those around her.

I don't agree with those positions at all, but I understand them.

Why can't they all have a chance to be great products of adoption or your loving family? Why do those questions suddenly hold weight when a sperm hits an egg?

""I am not financial stable enough to have a baby."" ""I am having problems with my partner."" ""I was raped."" ""My baby has a birth defect that is not compatible with life."" These reasons apparently no longer hold value or are deemed responsible when any women gets pregnant. However, they are perfectly reasonable and responsible reasons to get contraception.

da9v8db,TwoXChromosomes,"""Post-birth abortion"" is called murder. The definition of murder in no way mentions whether the human needs to be able to survive without the help of others. Taking the legal definition of murder, and the scientific definition of the fetal stage of a human, there is no difference between calling a post-birth abortion murder and a pre-birth abortion murder. Well aside from the fact that you don't PERSONALLY feel comfortable with that, it seems. I do invite you to prove me wrong in a legal sense as to why one is murder and the other is not.

Because this is not a person. Do you have the right to kill a fly? The collection of cells we're talking about here in most cases is less complex and certainly less cognisant than a fly. Given this, inflicting unwilling parents on a child when those cells do become a living, thinking, feeling being is actually causing great suffering. This is very immoral. The one choice prevents the suffering of a being - it is morally neutral, as uncomfortable as it might be to believe that - and the other is knowingly punishing a living being for the decisions of its parents.

There's no way most men could relate to this experience, because they've never been that afraid so constantly over time.

eum55bz,water,"While most things you stated are correct I still have my doubts about the clinical significance.   What's going on here is that your intestines absorb water using electrolyte pumps. No sodium, no absorption.   If distilled water is ingested, the intestine has to add electrolytes to this water first, taking them from the body reserves. The sodium would be pumped into the smaller intestines anyway for the co-transport with glucose. There are over 3 times the amount of secretions into the small intestine compared to the oral fluid and food intake. The minerals in these secretions are not fully recovered but the 50mg of solids we are taking as a cut-off seem insignificant in comparison.   more severe course of such a condition coupled with brain oedema, convulsions and metabolic acidosis was reported in infants whose drinks had been prepared with distilled or low-mineral bottled water (11).... I took the liberty of looking for that paper and was surprised with what I found. The cases were about parents giving their child water, not formula made with water just plain drinking water.  His mother related supplementing feedings of soy formula (obtained through participation in the Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Feeding Program [WIC]) with bottled drinking water since the onset of cold symptoms. Daily feedings consisted of three bottles of formula and three bottles of drinking water. The drinking water was viewed in this case as a safe and economical form of clear liquid to assist in the relief of cold symptoms. His mother stated the label on the bottle depicted a product specially made for infants. It has been cited in other papers, all citing it in regards to fluid supplementation. The cause given was not the form of the water but the different, immature renal function and the low glomerular filtration rate and an inability to differentiate between foods high in solute content and water. The spike in cases at the time of publishing was found to be caused by the move of formula manufactures to lower sodium in formula not because of the water used. Given how this would have been quite obvious if the writer of the paper had read the papers he cited I would like to approach the paper with some scepticism. Additionally there is the method they came to the results that soft water has an increased morbidity in regards to CVD. They used geographic correlation studies meaning my point about minerals in food is still valid. This exacerbates the issues if groundwater is both used for crop watering and drinking. They also found that there was no correlation in calcium concentration but only in magnesium concentration in the water. While areas with high magnesium had an effect on the mortality it did not have an effect on the incidence. This lack of magnesium in crops has since been documented and was common during the period of the geographic correlation studies talked about. The main reason was soil depletion and the use of magnesium poor fertilisers. The higher amounts of magnesium present in the soil and water in those regions would have made a difference. ""Epsom salts"" have been added to fertilisers since. This still might not be enough as ""modern"" diets as well as alcohol consumption and the over use of PPI's reduce a patients magnesium level and can result in conditions explaining the increased mortality. While the person writing the paper was on to something they seemed a little over eager and drew the wrong concussion with the data at hand. The supplementation of magnesium in iodated salt would be a practical and cheap solution to this issue if a magnesium salt is used with a high bioavailability. This would also reach the people who do not consume distilled water but tap water or other types of drinks low in magnesium.",The supplementation of magnesium in iodated salt would be a practical and cheap solution to this issue if a magnesium salt is used with a high bioavailability.

dp9d0sd,climate,"Lots of misconceptions in that response. Most of which I have already covered in other comments. 1 New reactors don't have those risks. To judge an entire field of technology by the failures of a few antique designs/bad management is not logical. That being said, existing nuclear is safer than renewables as it has a lower human ""death print"". The Externe study demonstrated how nuclear is by far the safest source of energy according to the data. 2 This isn't much of a concern, nuclear reactors are not required for nuclear weapons grade material. Any country that wants nuclear weapons can get them without having a nuclear energy program, North Korea is a clear example of this. Plenty of countries with nuclear energy don't have nuclear weapons. Many reactors can run off U-235 concentrations far below the weapons grade requirements. Thorium is another option coming through in some places. The Terra power reactor also burns the radioactive ""Waste"" (depleted uranium) from gen 2 reactors. 3 Gen 4 reactors are the answer to your long term storage objection. Solar PV produces 300X more toxic waste than nuclear and there are no requirements for long term storage. There is a toxic wasteland in Baotou China where wind turbines are made. If waste is your concern, nuclear is the way to go. The WS sectors are creating its own environmental catastrophes through standard operation while the waste footprint of nuclear is easily manageable. 5 The cost of nuclear is comparable to renewables and fossil fuels depending on local regulations and markets. 10 billion per gigawatt capacity may sound like a lot but compared to final outputs without subsidies and externalities factored in, renewables are even more costly. Ontario is an excellent example of a region that dedicated resources to scaling up nuclear and is cheaper than wind, solar and fossil fuels. Nuclear often gets a net tax where every other source including fossil fuels get net subsidies. 6 The grid needs base load and predictable inputs. This point demonstrates why nuclear is better than wind or solar. Wind and solar are unpredictable and intermittent, this is terrible for grid operators. The combination of dominant base load nuclear and controlled hydro is usually ideal. That last bit about the waste is not true. Even if there is a remaining amount of waste from gen 4 reactors that isn't transmuted, do you really think we wouldn't have a way of ""dealing with it"" in the next 100 years, let alone 100k? Even if we had to wastefully bury it. What is the issue? It is solid encased in ceramic and barely gives off any detectable radiation from natural background. The radiation from waste isn't that dangerous. You just don't want to be right next to it for years at a time or let some terrorist make a dirty bomb with it. The fossil fuel industry has pushed this false idea to make it seem like a problem that doesn't need to be such a big issue. If you keep relaying on solar and wind, fossil fuels will keep burning and the planet will keep dying.

They can withstand commercial crashing into them. they ran tests in the 70s, you can find them on youtube. Nuclear plants don't get diseases, walkaway reactor designs can shut down without any humans. Plants in the US are immune to tidal waves. The fukushima plant was being warned about their low sea wall prior to the event. NRC doesn't have that problem. Millions of lives die a year from standard operation of fossil fuels. Even if a plant goes into full meltdown mode, it lacks the ability to ""kill"" millions of lives. Chernobyl was an awful design and american engineers saw that. Engineers can do things right or wrong. We already know how to do nuclear right. You are spouting absolute nonsense and I'm starting to think you are just trolling.

ghdpjsz,Intactivism,"Yes I understand that it's important to certain religions. But that's a problem on itself. Religion is not an argument on itself. If you think religious freedom is also important, then it's only logical to let a child decide for themselves at the age of consent. But we all know that religious groups secretly don't want their children to have religious freedom. And this makes sense if they believe in some sort of hell. If you believe that someone will suffer for eternity by not following your religion, converting people would actually be the most moral thing to do. But religious frameworks are based on controlled delusions, not on scientific evidence. A foreskin is quite significant. It covers the sensitive tissue on the knob, so it won't dry out too much and develop callus. And during sex, it helps keeping the woman's natural lubricant inside, preventing it from becoming uncomfortable for her. And cutting it off causes immense pain. Especially since infants don't receive anesthesia. So it's basically torture. I made the comparison, because people can simply function with one toe missing. But since cutting off a foreskin is considered to be normal in some cultures, this is somehow morally justified. But cutting off a toe would be outrageous. How about giving child a tattoo? A tattoo wouldn't even remove healthy tissue. So would that be morally justified? Would it be okay if people give their newborn children a big tattoo on their chest? This subreddit is dedicated to promote keeping children's dicks intact. Basically is promotes the idea of simply leaving children's dicks alone. It requires some heavy mental gymnastics to see something weird in that.

Since your son's don't deserve to have 100% of their sensation just in case of a RARE infection, don't you think YOU should put YOUR genitals on the chopping block?

These findings remove key arguments used to defend the practice, they say. Friday Okonofua and colleagues at the Women’s Health and Action Research Centre in Benin City studied 1836 women, 45 percent of whom had been circumcised. During the operation, all or part of the clitoris and the labia are removed. Proponents of female circumcision claim it makes virginity at marriage and marital fidelity more likely. Opponents condemn it as dangerous and painful."" [ Oh forgot to mention one stipulation. Since your son's probably didn't get any pain killer and it wouldn't work anyways you have to have this done with no anesthesia. We want to be fair. Hey you already get to keep a higher percentage of nerves this is a minor stipulation I'm sure you understand. Dorsal Nerve Block and Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic Cream “Based on 35 clinical trials involving 1,997 newborns, it can be concluded that DPNB (Dorsal Penile Nerve Block) and EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic Cream) do not eliminate circumcision pain. None of the studied interventions completely eliminated the pain response to circumcision.” [ Why you ask? The penile nerves are far too complex. They are NUMEROUS and have many cords extending out into the skin. While you may block the dorsal nerve the perenial nerve is impossible to block and it inervates the sides and bottom of the penis.

gheghk6,Intactivism,"Psychological Effects of Circumcision\* **by Gocke Cansever** [** “Following circumcision, there was a remarkable decrease in the I. Q. obtained by this test and in the size of the drawing itself (Table 1). From the decrease in I. Q. we can assume that circumcision hampers smooth, spontaneous and efficient functioning by the child” Children drawl self After the mutilation....“the children feel 'smaller'. The body image shows a tendency to shrink, most probably this results from the feeling of 'being cut'. By depicting a smaller image of himself, the child may also be expressing his feeling of insecurity, inadequacy, inferiority under the impact of the outside world's attack on him” “*Disturbance in sexual indentification.* Following circumcision, all of the children showend some disturbance in sexual identification on the DAM test; however each in a manner peculiar to himself. An interesting disturbance was noted in the sex attributed to the picture drawn before and after the operation. Out of twelve children, five showed definite change in identifying the sex of the figure.” “*Regressive trends.* Tendency to regress toward more infantile and primitive modes of expression was observed following circumcision. Half the children attributed a younger age to their drawing after the operation, which may be indicative of a wish to be a 'baby' or to live in an earlier stage when life was less threatening.” “Another interesting regressive trait was noted in the responses to the 'three wishes' of the figure drawn. Following circumcision, two stated no wishes, one due to extreme withdrawal and the other from primitively expressed anger. Five subjects who had previously expressed more mature wishes, acceptable for their age level, openly manifested oral passive needs. A good example is the child whose preoperative respones was 'a ball, a whistle and toys'. Following circumcision, this child wished to eat 'plenty of food, cookies, custard and rice custard', the last being a mixture of milk and rice fed to infants. One very disturbed child expressed blatant oral aggressive drives. His preoperative response was 'find clothes, and a human being each day and talk to him. (Q: Why?) So that he can learn the best ideas and apply them in life.' In the post operative testing, this child wished 'Treasure, a very large pot, and to catch people so he can cook them in the pot and devour them.' The same child also linked the costumes in the 'trunk' item with extreme oral aggressive wishes, following the circumcision. He dressed his hero in 'terrible clothes' and sent him off 'to eat little children up'. “We note that following circumcision level I shows a significant increase, indicating to the fact that the operation is experienced by the child as an aggressive attack, with deadening implications. Although before the operation, too, the subjects were somehow anxious of an impending danger, they could more easily control their fear and were capable of expressing it in more subtle, symobolic ways.” “We note that following circumcision, a definite increase occurs in the incidental and non-appropriate use of instinctual energy, indicating a lack of integration of drives and impulses. We note also a striking increase in direct-unsocialized drive expression. These two findings indicate that following circumcision there is a marked weakening in the control of the ego over the primitive discharges, in inability to make appropriate use of instinctual energy, impulses breaking through in ego-alien and maladaptive forms. Due to the traumatic effects of circumcision, and resulting weakening of ego strength, instincts find direct expression, overwhelm the ego and lose their socialized character.” “Concomitant with the increase in the amount of expression directed to the self, there was an increase in aggressive remarks directed toward the mother figures.” “The changes noted in the occurrence of various determinants indicate to a generalized constriction inability to respond affectively to the emotional demands of the external world, and withdrawal from human relationships. When prior to circumcision the child seemed more spontaneous in the expression of feelings or needs, following the operation, they are reluctant to reveal their inner world and are apt to isolate and/or insulate themselves from the people around them.” “This general constriction and isolation may be a defensive protection of the self from the retaliations of the adults. Having been attacked and mutilated, the children may now be seeking safety in total withdrawal from interpersonal relationships and are thus protecting themselves from aggressive interferences.” “The main reaction to the operation is an increase in aggressive drives. Not only does the child feel attacked, but also, as a reaction strives to attack those who have mutilated him. The quality of the aggressive feelings is as archaic as the perception of the operation.In order to protect himself from the threats of the outside world and of the instinctual drives loosened by the operation the child's ego seems to find safety in withdrawal. As a defensive measure, the ego insulates itself from all stimuli and this is protected from external and internal dangers.” “This problem gains further significance when Nunberg's formulations of circumcision are taken into consideration. Nunberg postulates that circumcision may not only intimidate the boy's sexual impulses but may also stimulate this masculine strivings (Nunberg, 1947). How these two contradictory aims are achieved under the impact of circumcision deserves a great deal of attention. ” “A relationship was observed in the amount of information given to the child and his reaction to the operation. Those children who had received misleading information seemed to show greater disturbance than the two subjects whose mothers had enlightened and assured them. ”Infants don’t receive any explanation. They have no idea why they are in incredible pain. The earlier you do this in a child’s life the more influential the epigenetic change and the worse the psychological damage.","Although before the operation, too, the subjects were somehow anxious of an impending danger, they could more easily control their fear and were capable of expressing it in more subtle, symobolic ways.” “We note that following circumcision, a definite increase occurs in the incidental and non-appropriate use of instinctual energy, indicating a lack of integration of drives and impulses.

So I made him go out and buy lubricant because I couldn't bear the thought of the dry rubbing (Sorry if TMI). Anyways, my next boyfriend was Greek and I was so RELIEVED that he had this lovely protective layer of skin that you could move around. I ended up marrying a Chinese man (also uncut) and I gotta say to any ladies who claim to be weirded out by it - sex is so much more comfortable and PLEASURABLE! You MUST try it. I guarantee you'll never go back. Plus, if you're anti-circ like me, then you don't have to worry about them making the ""I want the baby to look like me"" argument and they can take care of all the ""how to keep your penis clean"" talks. Melanie R. Childers that is hilarious! All throughout my teen years all my partners were circumcised until I met my husband. Most boys around my age are cut. You know I locked that down lol in all seriousness I have always never seen a reason to circumcise. My mom kept my brothers intact. When I slept with my husband for the first time, it was his first time, and I the sex was crazy better than any of the times before. I didn't realize until later on that it was because he was intact. I didn't even know a lot of this stuff about circumcision until recently when I'd see mom's talk about it in mom groups when I was pregnant with my son. But I was always going to keep him intact.Jamie Rose My man is the only man i have been with who is intact. He has shown me a whole new world of how sex should actually feel like..Alexis Fossier My husband and I are both incredibly grateful that he is intact. Having had sex with both circumcised and intact men, I can reliably say that intact feels WAY better. There's never any abrasion or pain, like there often was with circumcised men, all thanks to my husband's penis working exactly the way it was meant to. Nothing else on the human body, whether male or female, functions quite like the male foreskin with the way it rolls back upon itself. It's an amazing organ!Ashley Doll I prefer anatomically normal penises. Intact penises are meant for intact vaginas. They’re ribbed for her pleasure (those ridges catch onto the g-spot’s ridges, as well as rub against the man’s penis head), and if you’ve only been with cut men — you’ve never felt gliding action. Sex with intact men is incomparable to sex with cut men. Those ridges (ridged band) and gliding action are always permanently loss due to circumcision. Once you experience intact, you never want to go back.Eden Rae Luscious Beauty and Sadness Beyond Words(love song for the NATURAL penis)“I am a foreskin novice. I have never known a lover with an intact penis; my six sons, of course, are intact, but I do not examine their penises! (Nor clean them for that matter, they clean themselves.) So in researching this newsletter, I was looking at pictures of intact penises on activist websites... and my response to them startled me. I will share my experiences here, in the interest of at least one mother or father reading this thinks twice about circumcising their baby boy.I used to think penises were rather bland and straightforward - nowhere near as interesting as the external female genitalia. But then I saw photos of intact, erect, adult male penises... and wow. Crazy arousal, sadness - mad thoughts ran through my mind, won't share them here, but my jaw was on the floor... I simply had no idea how luscious and sexy men could be. Intact penises look so hot... everything about them looks so wild and amazing. The foreskin adds such a level of sexy beauty to penises - a wild, sexy mystery. It is like a... veil that is drawn back, and slowly, dark, wet male beauty is revealed.Wow. Apparently on some TV show women were talking about non-circumcised men (I think it was ""Sex in the City"" or something) and they said ""eeewww!"" Well I say ""eeeewww"" to their silly reaction!!! Luscious mystery; intact loveliness; beauty and wild ecstasy unveiled... wow. Intact penises are the sexiest things I have ever seen. Their beauty makes my head dizzy. They - say the women who have been intimate with them - feel like silk, and are beautiful to have inside them. Men say foreskins feel good for them too - like soft, long hair caressing their penises. But it's built in...My husband is circumcised. Excuse me while I @%\^$#%$ % \^\*% \^%$$% out loud about that - what beauty have we both been deprived of? - what sweetness of ecstasy? Foreskins account for an enormous amount of the male sensory experience - and the female... sweet sliding skin that lubricates itself - wow. Wish I could have some, but I can't, never will, and it hurts. It really hurts. I am a one man woman, I love my husband. But my heart hurts. I wish so badly that he didn't get his penis cut apart as a baby boy - not just for my own selfish reasons of course, but also for his - can you imagine the pain of it - the foreskin, says one intact man, ""isn't the wrapper on the candy, it's the candy"". It feels good. So can you imagine the pain of having it sliced off???My husband says it doesn't bother him that he is circumcised. Well I'd say the same thing if my clitoris were cut off as a girl, and I'd never know the ecstasy of it. I'd not let it matter. But it would!!! A comparison that many women will relate to: women who have episiotomies (their vaginas cut open by their doctors or midwives in birth) often have reduced sexual sensation afterwards - the cut permanently severs sex-receptive nerves. ""At least I have a healthy baby"" - they will rationalize their loss of ecstasy with that - but- what if it's not true? What if the cut was done so the baby would just pop out instead of ease out? (Episiotomies have been proven in mountains of research papers to be cruel and pointless.) How could she rationalize that? ""I lost my orgasms so my doctor could get home in time for dinner"" - can you imagine the rage that she would experience if she understood what was lost? (And does she dare touch the rage, and see what lies beyond it?)Translate that into the male experience. If all those men who were ever circumcised understood that their penises could be have been particularly exquisite tools for pleasure (and that ""health andhygiene"" reasons for circumcising amount to nil) would they be so eager to circumcise their own little boys because it was ""good enough for them""? Do they dare touch the sex that was so quickly and permanently lost? It's a pain beyond rage. Why are beautiful bodies medical platforms for invasion? Why do cut genitals equate ""medical care""?I am so sad that neither my husband nor I can ever know him in his most natural form: intact- perfect- beautiful. He is beautiful as he is now, but he bears the mark of the wounded baby... and a mutilated man.”By Leilah McCracken Fact is, it is cutting off a piece of a child's healthy penis.","(Nor clean them for that matter, they clean themselves.) So in researching this newsletter, I was looking at pictures of intact penises on activist websites... and my response to them startled me. I will share my experiences here, in the interest of at least one mother or father reading this thinks twice about circumcising their baby boy.I used to think penises were rather bland and straightforward - nowhere near as interesting as the external female genitalia.",None,RedditExtension,None

j295two,IronFrontUSA,"from the FBI, who isn't using them interchangeably: The article is from The DHS not the FBI but ok... From the FBI website under Terrorism   The Bureau works closely with its partners to neutralize terrorist cells and operatives here in the United States, to help dismantle **extremist** networks worldwide  International and domestic violent **extremists** have developed an extensive presence on the Internet  These facilitate the groups’ ability to radicalize and recruit individuals who are receptive to **extremist** messaging  The insular nature of today’s violent **extremists** makes them difficult for law enforcement to identify and disrupt before an attack. Clearly, the FBI uses the terms interchangeably  In my view, there isn’t a lot of overlap between extremism and terrorism. Well, your view is a minority.   source=web rct=j url= ved=2ahUKEwivnNWgzqH8AhX2FzQIHXplCg0QFnoECCUQAQ usg=AOvVaw0MDKvs_ZY3R90UOaPEVvIu I'm not exactly sure what your wanting to show me but I'll go ahead and quote it  Domestic Violent Extremism The FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have categorized the **DT threat in terms of various forms of domestic violent extremism.** Domestic violent extremists (DVEs) support achieving political or social goals, at least in part, through unlawful force or violence. DHS asserts that DVEs present the “most persistent and lethal threat” to the homeland. The FBI made a similar assessment, stating that “trends may shift, but the underlying drivers for domestic violent extremism—such as perceptions of government or law enforcement overreach, sociopolitical conditions, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, misogyny, and reactions to legislative actions—remain constant.” According to Director Wray, the top DVE threat is from those the FBI identifies as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists. **Law enforcement often uses the term domestic terrorism to describe the act while using domestic violent extremists to describe the actors or the alleged actors.** For example, Director Wray, in describing the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has referred to those who engaged in violent criminal activity as “violent extremists,” but has classified the incident as domestic terrorism. The use of DVE may be due, in part, to the fact that no federal criminal provision expressly prohibits domestic terrorism. Additionally, the FBI does not designate any domestic groups as domestic terrorist groups. Emphasis mine   This is just saying we shouldn't use the terms extremist and terrorist interchangeably because you risk labeling non-violent extremists as terrorists. First, this just supports what I have been saying that the terms are used interchangeably. Second, the original article was about violent extremists.","The FBI made a similar assessment, stating that “trends may shift, but the underlying drivers for domestic violent extremism—such as perceptions of government or law enforcement overreach, sociopolitical conditions, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, misogyny, and reactions to legislative actions—remain constant.” According to Director Wray, the top DVE threat is from those the FBI identifies as racially/ethnically motivated violent extremists. **Law enforcement often uses the term domestic terrorism to describe the act while using domestic violent extremists to describe the actors or the alleged actors. ** For example, Director Wray, in describing the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has referred to those who engaged in violent criminal activity as “violent extremists,” but has classified the incident as domestic terrorism.",None,RedditExtension,None

As for the strawmanning, you've now said several times that I'm arguing the terms are never used interchangeably. I never said that, it's an assumption you made. I'm saying they're 2 distinct definitions, they shouldn't be used as such, and I provided sources from several countries, even government sources, stating the same. So. You agree they *should not* be used interchangeably. We agree *they should not be used interchangeably and its inappropriate that they are*. I've now provided several sources that not only state that they have distinct definitions, but they *should not be used interchangeably* *so why did you start this synonym argument in the first place, if we all agree that calling them terrorists is actually more appropriate*?

cu6w28g,FeMRADebates,"Another possibility I am curious about is whether or not you are able to mentally model *any* specific example of female-on-female abuse. Since /u/Xer0day has mentioned his anecdote of female-on-male abuse (if he hadn't, I still would have offered mine.. :P) and you clarified that your concern was unique to female-on-female abuse, perhaps that entire concept (let alone it's reported likelihood) strikes you as sufficiently alien and inconceivable that it couldn't really form a threat and even statistics claiming to favor it might conceivably feel unreal enough to you that you seek to find ways to trivialize them. Well, for example:   The stats you gave suggest that more abuse in total is comitted by women. That includes all types of abuse neglect, emotional abuse etc. while my statement was about sexual abuse. So what about sexual abuse in particular triggers your emotional response in a way that ordinary abuse such as hitting, starving, misplacing or exposing to dangerous situations (fire, electrical hazard, sharp objects, etc) are somehow rendered sufficiently acceptable to exonerate the population you've literally just admitted perform the lion's share of it? The best way to test this hypothesis (yes, about your mental state on the subject; which is at least our topic :3) would be for you to explore your emotional reaction to variants of a hypothetical situation where a particular daycare — by far the cheapest and most well respected in town — employs one specific female carer that you learn via unusual channels has been convicted in the past of female-on-female sexual child abuse. Can that trigger the same protective concern, or do you feel a motive to make mental leaps to deny the accusation or whether there exists any real danger? Do there exist any specific outcomes or traumas you actually believe could happen or is it especially difficult to credit any such situation as being capable of taking place in the real world?","The best way to test this hypothesis (yes, about your mental state on the subject; which is at least our topic :3) would be for you to explore your emotional reaction to variants of a hypothetical situation where a particular daycare — by far the cheapest and most well respected in town — employs one specific female carer that you learn via unusual channels has been convicted in the past of female-on-female sexual child abuse.

cu6qwyl,FeMRADebates,"Which suggest women abuse children more than men, not accounting for taboos. The stats you gave suggest that more abuse in total is comitted by women. That includes all types of abuse neglect, emotional abuse etc. while my statement was about sexual abuse. It includes abuse by parents, which is the vast majority of cases and something which would skew the data toward female abusers simply because more children are in the sole care of their mothers more often. It tells us very little about the actual risk of leaving your child in the care of a man or woman.  Anecdotal evidence. Does my anecdotal evidence of being sexually assaulted by an older female as a child hold the same weight as females sharing their stories with you? My anecdotal evidence doesn't need to convince anyone else but my own worldview is built on it. I only mentioned it because it corresponds to the statistics and what I know of human behavior. I know three women who were repreatedly sexually abused when they were children. All were abused by men. One was abused by three different men. I assume you are male. Even if I included your anecdote in my evaluation my conclusion is still that men present a greater risk to a little girl.  Still incorrect. As I said, traditional sexuality casts women in a passive role and most women take this on board. Sexual abuse is not passive. A woman could convince herself she is the passive party if she is pressuring a teenage boy to have sex with her but it is much more of a stretch to twist anything they do to a younger child into that model. Men have also shown themselves more likely to be willing to break social norms.","It includes abuse by parents, which is the vast majority of cases and something which would skew the data toward female abusers simply because more children are in the sole care of their mothers more often.
