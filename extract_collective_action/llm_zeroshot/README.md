This folder contains the code to perform the zero-shot classification of participation in collective action and its nuances.

The script `zeroshot_generation_simplified.py` performs the binary task, `zeroshot_generation_multi_direct.py` performs the multi-class task directly, `zeroshot_generation_layered.py` performs the multi-class task as a second step of the layered approach and `zeroshot_layered_end_to_end.py` determines the evaluation of the performance for the layered approach.
