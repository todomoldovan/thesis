Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. So here are my five F's of being five. Fantasy. Kids are amazing at jumping into fantasy, not just make believe but believe believe. We're in the car waiting for someone to come and help us because it's broken down. I suggest let's pretend we're space man.

Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. So here are my five F's of being five. Fantasy. Kids are amazing at jumping into fantasy, not just make believe but believe believe. We're in the car waiting for someone to come and help us because it's broken down. I suggest let's pretend we're space man.                                                                                                                                      |       SPEAKER_00       |    0.0    |  60.0   |   60.0   | https://www.buzzsprout.com/783020/4252475-best-of-singout-speakout-no-3.mp3 |     1     |        host         |    Simon Shapiro    |\n",

Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me but my will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well everyone it's been a crazy busy week and I'm literally stealing this minute here to myself amongst everything else to get the introduction to this week's episode in. Apologies it's very late. As I said I've been chasing my tail the whole week and I'm just feeding these.

Well everyone it's been a crazy busy week and I'm literally stealing this minute here to myself amongst everything else to get the introduction to this week's episode in. Apologies it's very late. As I said I've been chasing my tail the whole week and I'm just feeding these.

      "| I'm Simon Shapiro and this is Sing Out Speak Out. Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well hello everyone and welcome to Sing Out Speak Out episode number 20. I know crazy, it's going fast this crazy year that we are having 2020. I know for a lot of people the hard lockdown and the restrictions due to COVID-19 are still in full force and in Australia we are very lucky that we've managed to squash that curve for now due I think in part because we have a smaller population and we had advanced warning of what was happening in other countries so I think that held us in good stead but we're not over it yet of course and we're not gloating in any way whatsoever. But I know it can be tough when you're stuck in the same situation even if you might still have a job but you're working from home and one day you're homeschooling the next day you're doing your job at home and next day it's the weekend but it doesn't really feel like the weekend because you can't go anywhere. Every day is a bit the same. It's like Groundhog Day basically. So as I'm introducing songs to the Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere which I made with my great friends Mike Haveername and Lee Walker. I'm going to skip to track number four because it's called Today is Yesterday. I'm not going to say too much about the song I'll let the song do the talking but it was a lot of fun to record even though the message itself is kind of serious. All the horns and the strings you hear are played by real musicians all of those layered vocals we did together and just vocal on top of vocal and a lot of work went into this song it was a heap of fun. It's one of my favourite bass parts that I've ever recorded and thanks to our producer Lindsey Rhimes who was there for every note guiding us getting the best out of us when we recorded this song. I hope you enjoy it. Without further adieu this is track four from our album Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere. The song is called Today is Yesterday. I hope you have a great week.

      "| I'm Simon Shapiro and this is Sing Out Speak Out. Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well hello everyone and welcome to Sing Out Speak Out episode number 20. I know crazy, it's going fast this crazy year that we are having 2020. I know for a lot of people the hard lockdown and the restrictions due to COVID-19 are still in full force and in Australia we are very lucky that we've managed to squash that curve for now due I think in part because we have a smaller population and we had advanced warning of what was happening in other countries so I think that held us in good stead but we're not over it yet of course and we're not gloating in any way whatsoever. But I know it can be tough when you're stuck in the same situation even if you might still have a job but you're working from home and one day you're homeschooling the next day you're doing your job at home and next day it's the weekend but it doesn't really feel like the weekend because you can't go anywhere. Every day is a bit the same. It's like Groundhog Day basically. So as I'm introducing songs to the Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere which I made with my great friends Mike Haveername and Lee Walker. I'm going to skip to track number four because it's called Today is Yesterday. I'm not going to say too much about the song I'll let the song do the talking but it was a lot of fun to record even though the message itself is kind of serious. All the horns and the strings you hear are played by real musicians all of those layered vocals we did together and just vocal on top of vocal and a lot of work went into this song it was a heap of fun. It's one of my favourite bass parts that I've ever recorded and thanks to our producer Lindsey Rhimes who was there for every note guiding us getting the best out of us when we recorded this song. I hope you enjoy it. Without further adieu this is track four from our album Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere. The song is called Today is Yesterday. I hope you have a great week.

      "| I'm Simon Shapiro and this is Sing Out Speak Out. Here I give you the philosophies, ideas and songs I've been working on for many years but until now I've shared just too few of because I've been afraid of you and worse I've been afraid of me. My will to connect with you and share the best of me has grown greater than any fear and that's why I am compelled to Sing Out Speak Out. Well hello everyone and welcome to Sing Out Speak Out episode number 20. I know crazy, it's going fast this crazy year that we are having 2020. I know for a lot of people the hard lockdown and the restrictions due to COVID-19 are still in full force and in Australia we are very lucky that we've managed to squash that curve for now due I think in part because we have a smaller population and we had advanced warning of what was happening in other countries so I think that held us in good stead but we're not over it yet of course and we're not gloating in any way whatsoever. But I know it can be tough when you're stuck in the same situation even if you might still have a job but you're working from home and one day you're homeschooling the next day you're doing your job at home and next day it's the weekend but it doesn't really feel like the weekend because you can't go anywhere. Every day is a bit the same. It's like Groundhog Day basically. So as I'm introducing songs to the Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere which I made with my great friends Mike Haveername and Lee Walker. I'm going to skip to track number four because it's called Today is Yesterday. I'm not going to say too much about the song I'll let the song do the talking but it was a lot of fun to record even though the message itself is kind of serious. All the horns and the strings you hear are played by real musicians all of those layered vocals we did together and just vocal on top of vocal and a lot of work went into this song it was a heap of fun. It's one of my favourite bass parts that I've ever recorded and thanks to our producer Lindsey Rhimes who was there for every note guiding us getting the best out of us when we recorded this song. I hope you enjoy it. Without further adieu this is track four from our album Kiss Tone album Way to Nowhere. The song is called Today is Yesterday. I hope you have a great week. I'll be back next week with another episode of Sing Out Speak Out.

Mmm first of all, let's hit that But um Shit my take on what's going on is this is what the fuck we need this was the fuck outta happen cuz it's because obviously Like what else what else work What else we gonna do Niggas only open their eyes when niggas are riding Burning shit up tearing shit up So I mean I feel it for sure I'm definitely in agreement with that peaceful protest shit is dead Yeah, I'm not in the grouping with how many how many times you got a peacefully protest and then the shit don't change to be looked at as a Exactly how you don't see me as how you see Other than they can make it right I'm saying and they like like my only thing is with the comparing contrast with it On white people protests. They have stripes. They have Exactly and it's just like you can it's that's that's blay and racism that's blay and racism like oh These niggas can protest with guns and all that shit screaming and niggas niggas protesting because they want to go outside Where we don't quarantine a nigga die and we protesting all with thugs and we're fucking they want to bring up martial law Yeah, you know I'm saying where was where was the curfew when niggas was dying from COVID but you're mad because y'all can't go to the fuck you get a haircut Or you're mad because y'all can't do this y'all can't do that That shit just curbs you I just feel like you can't I can't sock you and your shit and then give me a How you react to how I suck to a shit?

Oh well, no black people don't do it like this like that shit That's your right loves me to see people even think exactly and then and then to see black people up under it like this is not helping Where where we're becoming with they like shut the fuck up. Yeah, that shit when I went I think it was a post like this hired black nigga look and it's like that like yes, man. So we're not gonna burn your shit. Yeah I'm a song bro. Yeah, but I do feel like some people are miss I'm not gonna say interpreting Like you got some people looting you got some people looting saying like okay We bought the Rob Louie the time because Louie the time don't fuck with black people But you you want to rob it to where they shit. Yeah I mean, I just like did you see the post where the niggas was going in a surfboard story like black people not that people Don't fucking serve like I've seen some people some people Yeah, but some people is taking it out of context using using using this as an excuse to go still and all of that I don't agree with that shit though. Yeah, I don't agree with that But I feel like if you was to go in like to make a statement if you was to go in Louie or high-end designer who you feel is racist Mm-hmm take that shit and throw it outside and burn that mm-hmm. We'll just burn the store down period. Yeah, you know, I'm saying that's that's effective To me effective process Like it's like make it fuck fuck your product. Yeah, because you losing cheese on this shit Right, I'm not distilling the weird and then you got all niggas Kirk kids lined up wearing Gucci like that shit That's right. Honestly, I haven't seen Louie Gucci none of them make statements like yeah certain certain companies making statements But you none of the big fashion luxury houses, but I mean luxury fashion houses making statements So we as a people have to like we we have to like really stand for something and be like, okay We're not fucking with you because remember remember when Gucci had did like blackface or something My clear deal some right and niggas was not niggas never stopped a bond. Oh and like It's like okay, you know wearing that shot right forward as before like I'm wearing I'm wearing like, you know, that's how that's how Floyd was Floyd Floyd Like Even a side rock you a side rock you like about the first the Ferguson protests a side rocky like shit I never experienced that you know, it's cool. I never experienced And I mean I'm in so ho that I live in so ho we don't have protest and and I Like when the shit first broke out and it's like, you know, George Floyd died in Minnesota Why is niggas rioting in Minnesota? I mean why is niggas rioting in Atlanta? Why is niggas rioting in Detroit? Why is niggas? Because that shit hurt all over that's why not even just that but it's like bro nigga if you harm one of us you harm All of us exactly that's why I'm saying hurt all over I feel I feel right. I feel the same pain that his fucking family is feeling because nigga that could have been Exactly and that's that's what I'm looking at it like exactly to see black people That's why I wanted to start this. That's why I wanted to start this shit like make it a period Resting peace and condolences to everybody family George Floyd Brianna trailer. I mean Brianna is it trailer Taylor Taylor? It's countless names. Am I arbor you can go back Sean Bell Sean Bell Martin, you know, I'm saying we can we can go honestly all night. Yeah, it's so many it's so many names So like I said, I want to give condolences to all of their families Because you can't bring that shit back. Yeah, and they're gonna always feel that too And a trauma behind it nigga, they never gonna fuck with no police no more not even that but it's like the trauma behind our Community though, right we grew up saying like it's not it's not just the nwa song to say fuck the police Mm-hmm if you go to nigga my hood to Hollywood, bro niggas really like nigga fucking police All right, you know them some whole ass niggas it'll be a little nigga. Why the police a whole ass nigga? She's I just don't fuck with 12 right You just don't make it that this shit like we what like you know saying kids is this shit is definitely gonna act and They see initiative right and when they have that as older as they get they just gonna be like they gotta fuck the police Trust them something happened. I can't even call who's supposed to protect and serve Over over a fucking a $20 bill that your thought was fake Regardless it was nonviolent, you know I'm saying what the fuck is who got this your neck on this nigga? Me folks. That's what it was about. Yeah, it was it was a forgery charge They thought he had a fake $20 bill You know I'm saying this nigga lost his life over a 20 over a fake where they was fake or not even if it was fake damn I had to die behind this shit $20 for 20 fucking fake $20 bill or a real $20 bill That's why that's why I say it don't matter if it was fake or not. It's a piece of paper that I just died behind And when you when you see like the videos and shit he wasn't resisting they got they got a video They got a video where he was resisting they got a video and being his ass Like all type of shit like come on bro like the nigga had to die behind this. So what do you what do you feel is the remedy? How does this shit stop for real to like not no pseudo stop not no I feel like white people Caucasians have to They have to stop it. We not pressing ourselves nigga. We not out. We're not outputting art You know I'm saying so you saying today they have to stop with they have to why people have to get in front of this shit And tell them like they have to cut out racism. You have to cut out racist police You have to think that's real though. Like do you think that's like that's that you think that can really happen? Yeah, I don't I mean it ain't gonna happen in the day It ain't gonna happen in a month because because all white people all white people got different fucking views But that's what it's gonna take bro because of because those because the white people are the ones that's a person as bro It's Well, so what do you think what do you think gonna happen? What do you think has to happen for the change for it to change bro? Everything has to come down every war got to come down It has to be which I don't think we'll happen. So you say we got to burn this bitch down and rebuild I don't know. I'm in a in a figurative that okay the laws that are in place needs to come down It's no who makes the laws though. That's what I'm saying white people exactly That's why I'm saying white people have to get out in front of this shit and make a change But it's all we can do all we can do all I feel like we could do we could protest to get them to make that change We can riot to to get them to make that change we could do this we could do that But until they get it through their motherfucking heads and say like you come up with it be able today Mm-hmm. We have the power to veto that we have the power to not agree. I'm saying that shit the whole process of us making be It shouldn't even be no you can't agree and I don't agree. It should be negative. Okay in the what is it? The Constitution with three-fifths of a man to this day that has never been changed So it's like until all this he come down because like racism is is rooted in America's being So do you think so do you think we need more black politicians more black? Senators representatives state representatives does that in the third absolutely we definitely do and we need We need it to be not necessarily deemed us We need we need people to say like it's okay. They're like that's straight. You know saying like it's like Straight they're going to school to actually be somebody. Oh, you know I'm saying like cuz like Years ago, it's like you're going to school. I think it's a ham On the block. You get more you get more love for going to jail than you do to college You know I'm saying and it like the whole narrative of Being somebody needs a change. You know I'm saying so so we changed the narrative of being somebody. Okay, go to school Get that degree Become elected officials Then that's then that's what changes it no because it's still it's still higher up You know saying just because exactly so and that's why I say the white people the white Cuz even in even then we get those elected officials a lot of them be puppets That's what I'm saying. So you know Donald Trump be like Nick. We've got to stop racism today That's not gonna do shit. So that's like the whole system as a whole has to be eradicated We have it. We got to throw this bitch away They can start from ground zero built this bitch up and they gave precept upon precept truth But as long as long as this racist as long as racist people can have they hands on that Building it up is never gonna be how we need it to be and I feel that and that's why it just it It never worked with even white people nigga Bernie Sanders been in front and I've been in front of me We got to stop this move that niggas official oil it But see this this this is what I don't like about Bernie Sanders and they go always giving a fuck up I mean I feel it even after I even after I donated my cheese I feel you That's personal with you not so that's why you like you know saying fuck it I'm not saying fuck Bernie Sanders cuz I feel like what he stand for and what he doing and what he says Even though a lot of times and shit that he say is like outlandish I feel like he's still on the front line with us Which he is but it's like Keep constantly getting your shit blue every time you stand up Yeah, and that's what like bro, but that's what I'm saying Maybe maybe maybe per maybe presidency not for Bernie Sanders. Yeah, maybe but it's other things that he can do outside of Being a president for sure is other ways that he can make change like I'm not gonna lie He he fuck with the hood niggas niggas fuck with Bernie Sanders like talking to Cardi B Talking to different black celebrities shit like that that that helps Because he influencing them to help influence us But it's like you gotta you gotta get you a post bro. You know I'm saying you got to get you a set post and Continue and continue to try and make change instead of every time they get hard But that's what I'm saying as far as the shit got to come down because it's like Nick you shouldn't have to you have to get no post now If you want to just be on some shit you should be able to be on some shit without without happen I feel like on some shit like how you like bro run for office for no, you know I'm saying What the first the first thing I said was what I'm gonna agree for that shit, right? I feel like if you if this is who you are like of course you shouldn't just let anybody in But if you got influence and people listen to you and you can you know saying get the people to To feel inspired then hard man. I mean this this is what you're supposed to be doing type shit This is Obama runs. Just so you know, but it's shit. That's okay But it shouldn't be no barriers like all right well, you're not you're not skilled in this okay, so a little professional That's what I mean by the sister whole system. You see a ham is tell right I have So you know how they had the I don't want to spoil it, but fuck it so and ham is tell they basically had to fucking Spot tear me stage terrorist attacks stage this stage that so that they can bring the laws down and re-change it Dude thing that I could possibly happen with us if we bring down the motherfucking law But the thing is I feel like it could if we as a people got established with education I Feel like we just now right now that we are let's burn. Let's do this You know saying like back in the day when it was the black Panthers But they was educated and what the fuck was going on so there wasn't granted phones Well, not at the time they won't just put out the phones if a cop was on some bullshit They come in with a strap blowing that shit off or shoeing like nigga in article X I niggas says we have to like to do this right now. We don't have that we not there we not educated enough Educated enough so we get educated and be like, okay, this is how this how we're gonna Stage these these cools and you know saying bring shit down. Yeah, if I see we happen the only thing is our Oppressors data ones educated so next agency they haven't fake police go start these rights and get them violent And you know saying they changed in there because they already ahead We got ahead and like really set and thought I was like, all right, babe. We got to do this I think we could do anything. It's just we just always so divided but like but right so we divide it That's what I'm saying since we since we are the minority That's why I think that the majority has to get out in front of it to change it I mean, I'm feel like we do my we the minority no more. You don't think so I think that's kept I mean Knew like I feel like that's subject. I feel like you write cuz I mean I'm agreeing with you us being a minority is subjective. That's more like a that's more just like some shit that they say Because we now white, but I feel like they have to get out because like I said everybody most elected officials are puppets Yeah, and it's all all trickled all trickled down from somebody. So that's why I feel like it's important for I Feel like it's important that white people or Caucasian whatever the fuck I don't really give a fuck is my podcast. I'm gonna call it what I want to call them Have to get out in the front line because like I said, we're not pressing ourselves Yeah, you know I'm saying yeah, but and I feel you though And I feel like with them getting out I feel like if there was the ones to be like look We need to bring this shit down right they need to be like all right But but it need to be white people as a collective But you can always had a one or was alive when Martin Luther King was loud when it was fucked that nigga the Indians Fuck that nigga not So Two and two like shit we all get on the same accord which would never be never There's something out of chance period though something has to change for sure fast and quick and in the hurry And I feel like I feel like I Them getting the whole ass senses would would not suffice. No, you know I'm saying But it's a lot of people saying like they get just first of all they charge the nigga with third degree murder That's not I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna possibly get out of jail with that I mean there's a lot, but I never heard a third degree murder until So I guess like first degrees will you first degree second degree third degree? I think third degree is like the less the lesser of them all So that's dinner, but it's what is is that above manslaughter is that basically manslaughter? It's above manslaughter, but it's like Nick and Nick like he could still First degree you getting like we're gonna jail for life. You know I'm saying you're gonna you're never gonna You might you're never gonna get parole none of that shit. You're stuck in there. You might not get the death penalty But you in that bitch third degree It's right, but it's so much stuff with that though. There is why I don't be gonna get charged my father Finish up finish up finish up. No, I was just trying to explain what the degrees of it is, but where But at the end of the day third degree is the It's not what he should be charged with It's on camera. We have a multiple multiple videos You got this big platter of evidence. There's no fucking is no fucking way and then I didn't say like get off that nigga He can't breathe you know, I'm saying and then you get a fake autopsy report that that shit blew me Yeah, fake autopsy talking about this nigga already sick that shit blew me up. What the fuck so if I Listen that basically basically what they saying is Excuse me is if I got cancer and a nigga shoot me well, I already had cancer. So I died You exactly but they already had underlying health problems But they tried to negate the fact that he still died as as fixiation. I heard a fuck you said Yeah, that's what I did and it's like like niggas so then the family went the family goes back and gets a real Autop or get a personal autopsy. I think off that alone. They should be convicted exactly cuz y'all try to cover some shit up but it's like so you think so you think the Minneapolis uh They lose the apartment. What is it called a coroner or whatever? Yeah, you think that they should be a lot of business Y'all your license need to be revoked. Y'all shouldn't be able to practice mortuary science wherever the fuck that shit is More nigga y'all nigga shouldn't be able to do that shit. I'm more cuz y'all Obviously y'all got paid off right obviously the more real factor Nigga you or the police the police just told y'all like this what we gonna we gonna Draw this up as this yeah, but but still regardless. We are more alert. We are real real integrity yet as a as this is the business that I'm in I'm gonna tell the truth right and I'm saying that your shit being compromised. You need to be out of business Right you need to be your your business license need to be and I'm crazy is remember. I was telling you about that docket docket series on Netflix was called um How to cover up a drugs kind of and it was about it was a list of it was about the bitch that was she did like the csi And all of that and she taking her drugs getting high She talking about she wanted to try crack just because she wanted to try This bitch was taking a fucking meth it was liquid meth she dropping and dropping her tongue every day the bottle lasts to eight years Damn. God damn You know i'm saying hi every day for eight years and the bitch got probation or some shit She didn't go to jail. She went to jail for like I want to say It was two of them the indian lady went to jail for six months and the other lady got pro the white lady got probation The white collar crimes broke the fact that we call them white collar White if you right is just it's just so it's so much systematic right Racism a white collar crime Like basically basically what you're saying is this is a crime that only a white person can commit or that they only smart even When I went to jail bro when when i'm sitting in that bitch they like oh well We know that you're not smart enough to do this blah blah blah blah on your own Like that's that's what they telling you in there. They telling you like this is a white collar crime You not smart enough to figure out no shit like this. You're not smart enough to do no shit like this So just tell us who like you know i'm saying like that's how they base it off They base it off like basically saying like this is a white person crime out of it That bitch like she was niggin a hairy Fucking gas station.

Yeah I feel like that's what the police need to go through No for sure the police need to be vetted and i say something interesting like if a nigga Going to study law i take them about eight years to do so You shouldn't this be uh Negative over 18 and you want to protect the server you can just be a cop Because you went through the police academy No, it need to be you need you need like a physical and a mental evaluation I feel like badeshia of watchmen was so perfect that like if you if you have a reaction like this But that's why i was watching this That's why i fucked up watching myself so good so uh so hard because we talked about watchmen on here too So go to the previous episodes. Yeah, this is no other bitches honestly because i don't know which one it was but Watchmen man. They they they talked about racism Every episode honestly in watchmen it was reversed because remember at the end the white nigga said It's it's so hard being a white man in america right now Oh, yeah, you know what i'm saying?

He like it takes a small bit of white Brainwashing to bring out the coonship. No, he's saying take a sprinkle in he's like a spray He's saying take a sprinkle of white brainwashing to bring out the biggest coons He said I'm gonna say that again a sprinkle of white brainwashing can bring out the biggest coons Yeah, and it's like anything I do to appease black people Niggas and get like that's it. That's how you say when the when the cops taking the knees back in the day Yeah, it is like that but back in the day I remember a white person do like the smallest thing they'd be like oh, he's invited to the cookout I used to hate when people say it that Like get the fuck out of here like right? I'm not like even even with the like you said with the police and she's doing police do I'm not about to applaud a fish foot not drowning, bro. Exactly. You're a police officer protecting serve That should be kneeling. This is what the fuck you took a oath This was the fuck you signed up Police Academy and did all that bullshit first of all your lame ass woke up and was like I'm about to go to the police Academy. I want to be a cop. Let me sign up. I Ain't gonna lie for the rest of my life. I want a lot niggas up. That shit I'm not gonna lie. You've got to have people to do that shit, but that shit lame to me Like if you a black person to you shot like to me, I feel I don't I don't feel no way But like I want to I watch a video today that it was a lady She was talking to a white nigga, and she was like if you want to give a copy some advice tell us ask to quit Get a new career to get a new career Get a new career choice get a new career path, but I want to know what possesses of men To stay as a black man to be on a side exactly like you got all these people not yelling at you They like just need what is there and then ain't for no fucking cuz you need a job because it's a million John's million jobs, but you think it paid them if you was able to get a police job You can get whatever the fuck you on that means you have no right. You have no feeling you have none of that shit You're good. You're in a clear Get you an entry-level job or something, you know I'm saying and make the same amount as a police officer sure If you not no sergeant no captain no chief none of that even you don't make nothing you have a nine to five You making the same as other niggas that go to work and whatever quick and long No quick and long might make a little bit more, but you know I'm trying to say though It's still though like it's not it's not the cream of the crop job You can write that motherfucker and still be straight right instead of being a fucking weirdo And want to work for the law. That's lame as hell as a as a black person. I just don't I'm gonna agree with that shit You know I'm saying right because I feel like that the whole point the whole origin of Police is on some racist shit. That was going to catch slaves Exactly And a lot of people don't know that the fucking first police force task force whatever fuck you want to call it was a slave Was run away slave patrol. That's what it was. So it's like it was run away slave patrol They were literally made to stop black people having friends in this year. Yeah, so that's it just and it's like That shit need to come down Police like me. I a y'all need to do your job and turn over affairs Mentally valuations they need to do that fucking job High glass face had that bubble. They need to sit niggas in that bubble and say it what you feel about non-election What the fuck you feel about the KK State police or Michigan State Police officer just got fired because he had a KK K application as I don't get an application Yeah, well Apparently since it's an organization and all this you got to apply and all this shit You know, he's just needed to be fired in you racist period racist proof. That's what they need to damn that That's what they need to screw up down there all that all they cribs. Yeah Not even that I ain't gonna lie Bro, they need every one that he associate with is racist, right? All his friends like the force are racist It's a reason why you are friends. You know, I'm saying you know, he was racist You wanna say shit? So just like the law you guilty by associating your racist by exactly need to fuck out of here You tear down they hold department Yeah, shit weird That shit is weird is here bro. I ain't gonna lie to this side. They just such a bad bitch On top of having a great voice. She's just cute as hell You know, she'll be a bad woman My father she's a bad. She's a she's a pretty female Even in her old a even she still she old and she still You feel me? I was still So Sunday can you and be like fuck this you're gonna be like I Probably a high bar me like I genuinely like her music though like she's a I can be love her music. She she is to me Would you know, I go is to these new loves, okay? That's a good comparison to that. Okay. They love her her vibe and all that shit And so they was still on that she just was more It wasn't on the open she still talking about fucking she still talking about her niggas. She still talking about doing what she wanted to do But like Janet echo Make myself Fucking I'm a pussy fairy whatever the fuck and you have a man. You want me listed Every girl is not the pussy girl. Mmm. Get that shit out your bio comments Emojis that shit, you know, I use her name You feel me be all like if that's the term she coined man. That's her Other on this bitch. I'm pussy for it is pussy for you that shit but I have bought up the fucking end in the quarantine for a reason Okay, we better get back out in the open about to be back to doing shit. What's the first thing you gonna do? What's the first restaurant you gonna hit? I'm definitely in RC for sure. I mean, I've been door-dashing I mean, I've been definitely getting carry outs But I'm still gonna wait to see because I feel like everything is all teary or motive. You know, I'm saying so I don't know I really don't you think they open you think they open them back up to kind of slow down the riots To make people a little bit more happy It's too a piece for short, but if you like look at the trends around the world, bro Everybody caught a second wave, bro, right of the corona And that's the thing you can catch it twice. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying So but our second wave hasn't hit you know, I'm saying so it's like bro. It's not they never said okay We have this under the lid we have It's not shit even if they do come on the vaccine. I ain't gonna shit But there's no way to treat it's no real real way never say like okay, this is we We have slowed down and it's turning around Corona virus is running on You know saying they not on it. Do you think after the protest is gonna be more? More cases. No, I Don't know. I don't know what to expect. I don't know what's going on because like I'm sure you don't think the cases on spike I feel like all the people in the numbers was kept I don't know what the fuck is going on for well Of course, I'm the numbers was kept because unless you went to the hospital or actually got checked a lot of people didn't get a check So unless you got a even ones that did get checked like I think if you had an underlying health issue They was just saying this girl to say it's corona You know just like how they was giving hazard pay and shit like that The hospitals was getting more cheese too. Like oh it's Corona. Oh, all right We give them like it's for them to pay the nurses 5x. I think they had me making at least 15 You know what I'm saying like they're not just where was the money coming from? So you think it was more like a profit. Yeah, yeah That was man. I profited off niggas saying oh, I got corona, but niggas niggas was dying and shit from that Numbers niggas definitely were dying and you know rest in peace to other people who lost their life to the corona families You know who lost loved ones to the corona everything like that, but it's like do we know if that was a corona? Right do we know if that's really what killed them? And then a lot of people it was it was there wasn't feeding people at hospitals because there was so many people It was a lot of resources It's a lot of stuff going on with like if you already sick you need you got diabetes and you need to be fed every six hours Or however frequently they got to get it. You're not getting sugar. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so now you now you fucked up You don't wanna in an induced coma that had nothing to do with corona It's just you was on some bullshit here. Right. They're gonna say oh, that was a corona Because I'm not gonna lie the medical industry medicine industry whatever you want to call it. What is that industry call? It's a bill is billions of dollars in it is billions of dollars off niggas being sick Exactly the medicine really don't do shit, but make sure dorming a nobody and don't eradicate the secrets and that's why They that's why if you think about that's why they have these big-ass cancer institutes Let's say you got cancer send you to this cancer Institute. Let's say we treat and cancer these celebrities these Billion dollar companies they're gonna donate millions and millions and millions Just because we said that these people got cancer and we treat you know And I feel like every and they at those they they already know what it is and what it is and they have like let's say out of a hundred We're gonna cure ten mm-hmm The rest is gonna die and we just gonna take that money that was for the rest and do whatever the fuck we want with it It's appropriate the funds and but and this the thing how can you really tell us that we're not doing this because They can't the medicine is so high already How the fuck can you tell us what the numbers is? That's why that whole shit, bro. It's really the best medicine is your food Yeah Definitely being healthy That's the best medicine all sickness comes from mucus the less the less mucus you have in your body the less Sick you gonna be exactly if you with a juicer fool girl You and mucus and mucus and all of that shit comes from food it comes from me White man diet exactly that we didn't we wasn't originated to have We wasn't we wasn't in Africa eating Bison and you know I'm saying like that just wasn't us. I don't have a lamb chops are good as him Great, so I think black people made that great and chicken So you think so you think so you think the first nigga that had a lamb chopper like let's chop this up and cut it Could you? Jesus knows the email So but lamb chops is different though. That's still part of them. So I'm like I can go I can go get some like some lamb rice and shit from like a Bengali restaurant any restaurant whatever and it's not gonna taste shit Like you work you have a lamb chop, but it's still the seasoning and shit to the go on that Yeah, but I don't feel like I don't feel like it's the same part of the length like a man's chops Not and just you know them cutting a piece of this off and a piece like a chicken breast and a chicken wing off I season it the same is gonna taste the same But you got different places who gone they're gonna get the slab of lamb and not seasoning how they chicken wing and a chicken Bex don't taste the same to me I mean, I'm talking about like the season I'm talking about dark meat like me It got different, you know textures, but all the noise like you season at the same we gonna taste it Mmm, we got a great disagree on that Because if I if I'm price and chicken and I fry I fry all wings and then I find me like two breasts my breasts is not gonna taste like the wings It's gonna it might be like season the same whatever, but I feel like different parts of the animal tastes different Like chicken gizzards don't taste like chicken Like tough, you know, you got to chew them bitches for a minute I'm thinking about grabbing some The bar seven make a statement I think it's on you, bro. It's on you and what you stand up for and what you Would choose no, I don't think I'm gonna stay with another I'm not gonna lie. I feel like a lot of a lot of the statements are being made just cuz people saying you didn't make these Not even that it's just because black people are their consumers I mean shit whilst with that make it But no, I'm saying as a majority of their consumer so what all that cheese niggas just had Niggas went to where did they go? They went to hutch. They went on Gucci They went on you know, I'm saying I feel like they went to Atlanta to go shop as sex and do this and do that So I feel like we're the majority So that's why they have to fucking make those statements because if they don't make those statements They I think they in fear and we won't shop with them no more Because cancer Cancel culture, I don't think it's a real thing because But I think niggas do get canceled and you can see you can see the The numbers changing for sure. It's a real thing better than I feel like we stick to it It'll be real you know, I'm saying like that's the thing niggas be half and half niggas Some people like fucking I'm gonna some people don't stand for shit some people just like fucking they got want to be sweet I don't give a fuck they didn't per like like Floyd Mayweather like a sir rocking me like Yes, so that's but that's why we got to be more on some solid shit We got to be more on exactly that's up solidarity Then after that was the whole point of the blackout tools We got to stand together We got a because only we the only ones that's gonna take up for us because obviously you see But it's crazy that you sent it because it's a lot of I see a lot of like Male figure saying oh this person is standing up. I seen bezel say like all right. Well, that's a little louder I'm touching the main dance. I don't know about You know exactly that's the point I'm making but I don't women not doing that though. How many of the Chinese restaurant I mean not Chinese restaurant, but how many of the little nail parlors and shit? How many of them said something? How many of them was like oh, we not we sorry about what's going on where we are their number one consumer We are there the airbags in the gas stations and shit I feel what they're going besides y'all in our hood y'all making y'all make y'all take a nap black dollar Y'all capitalize off it capitalizing off of it and that's you make it my whole point. That's why certain companies are doing that I'm agreeing with you. I'm saying I'm just saying that I mean to say making my point But you add into the point certain companies doing that because of the black dollar without that black dollar Yeah, you gonna yeah, you got the rich white people whatever But you're gonna you're gonna see a difference in those numbers And especially when you got all these employees to pay these warehouses that have the bills have to get paid in the warehouses On top of you having to feel that warehouse that way employees to make your product You know I'm saying you lose that money the numbers get cut short the numbers get cut You know I'm saying Now we can't now we can't fund this warehouse and this warehouse now we can only fund these you know I'm saying So that's the only reason that a lot of these niggas coming out even even saying shit like Even rebock. I'm not I'm not saying I got anything personal against rebob or rebock blatantly said like nigga without Without the black community without black people. There's no rebob But that's that's the world though without the world I mean without black people in the world, bro. There will be no world, bro Exactly like a lot of like if you really look at this whole country was built on black people not even just that bro They came they came in bro. They bro white people wouldn't have been fit They would have starved to them bro if Native Americans didn't take them under that wing like this is how you live Right, it's how you be a human right? It's how you watch it like the more is once a year Bro out of all history you hear black people we are prominent success Egyptian gods kings or People people used to go to Africa to study us nigga, but but I'm saying all through our history.

This how you take a shower It's how you stop sexual disease Ghosts niggas this a piece of pussy right there, but fuck on that Great, that's what happened up, but it's like just throughout history, bro We had to show things what it was to finesse how to beat people Yeah, so really why people I need to pay homage, bro.

That's his that's his whatever you want to call it. That's his Monocur whatever his that's I don't know what the fuck you call this is lame. Yeah, basically Motherfucking slogan. I don't know But um basically that's what happened and then you know basically he just basically he trying to spin it off Like I'm just trying to have a conversation. That's not that's not this time for the conversation And I sent you that video I sent you that video. I can't I can't remember I don't know his real at but it's like it's called pardon pardon me with Pete Or whatever I said I sent you the video. I think like watch it whatever I sent you the video and that nigga basically was just Taking that nigga head off a 15 minute straight. Oh, no, you did I didn't get to watch it. I was running around earlier But this the thing about that nigga taking that nigga head off 15 minutes straight that niggas said straight facts He had graphs and charts He you know, I'm saying it's like nigga is no First of all, this is not the time for that second of all, there's no such thing You know I'm saying what white people kill white people wise and I call white on white crime some people call it that though It's not coined is that but some people definitely call it because of that people people definitely be like shit Like why don't I cry I never heard nobody say that any time I've ever heard any time I've ever heard on like so You never heard on Mexican or Mexican? No Shit, I did I never heard who you listening to but it's like but in any race though people are gonna kill With the leading enemy in their race is always gonna be there If you go to a hick time right now black weren't killing white who hate times but the difference is it's fucking police killing us It's a big difference in if I kill you granted that's not right But why did you swear? Oh, you did exactly why did you know that's protected? Why didn't because that's protecting and serving you're not held to the higher state exactly you're a regular Citizen exactly as you you take that the law exactly you take that oath you automatically jump from here to here Yeah, you are held to you should be held to a higher standard and that's why I think all of them should give life Exactly over the exact and that's what and that's what bro was saying in the video you held to a higher standard You need to be sentenced at a higher standard. Yeah for sure. It's just nobody asked you to Wake up and go do that shit. You wanted to go do that shit I can't get all the favor people did that exactly, but that's what I'm saying though. So but basically in the video basically in the video like I Am gonna get the I'm gonna get the name of the video. I don't put it in a description of shit But basically and he explained it to a tee like for everybody that don't understand Why that why that shit was wrong if I'm not explaining it to you good enough for you to understand why that shit was wrong if Christian I explained to you to understand why that shit was wrong this nigga explained exactly at like I said Nick had charts Specific fucking facts everything and it was straight to the point It wasn't no at the end of the day, bro at this at this time and what we doing right now and what's going on right now It's not that time that had a conversation. It's definitely not that time. It doesn't matter what we think about that right now Yeah, no effects. It doesn't matter what we think about that right now and Us as a people can only stop black on black crime You hear what I'm saying the government can stop fucking put the fucking police killing us races all that shit That has to be bought to a forefront and stop But you always had crime. No, you always have people in there, but that's what I'm in a city crime in a city crime In your community like I said you can you can slow that down? We can stop that That's why they have program after school program all of that shit to try and get the kids off the streets to try even get the older adults to Coach and do other shit than whether than being in the streets. That's something that we got to stop a pretty police brutality What the fucking we do besides what we doing? I feel like Rioting and shit is the way to go. That's what I'm saying. What the fucking we do except besides writing We need to get educated and I feel like we had the time With Martin Luther King and that's run as course. It's now time to listen to the words of Martin Malcolm X and Cop smack you you smag as bad For real bro, we it's just it's just time to be on that bro You make them cops acting a desire in a desire manner, bro And the only way you can do that is by being educated But we didn't get to we didn't we didn't need the selmas we didn't need the city ends. We didn't did the That's like how much how much more do you want us to do that's not gonna work? That shit don't broke, but I'm saying but but since Trevor I'm Martin. I was like my freshman year in college. That was about 2011 12 We've been marching since then it's Before before before then but like in our lifetime like a yo and your generation Yeah, you know I'm saying our lifetime when it's prevalent of this is what's going on Okay, we did that right how long how long do we have to keep saying this how long we gonna have to keep singing the same song Don't kill us hands up. Please don't shoot. Please look at me consider me as a man sir You It's fuck you or not, but that's what I'm saying a lot a lot of I feel like he don't realize that shit like he Once again, you and elect first of all you an elected official you and elected official When you got elected nigga you your whole soul your whole soul purpose should have been to help uplift us But you gonna bring up some shit like that at this time It was going on didn't get another nigga on there and bring up some some old bullshit Oh, yeah, I don't live was another nigga I don't never saying some old bullshit and at the end of the day It's just all bullshit and that's why I call him Detroit villains because I feel like they're not really with us They not really bro mad bro mad cuz his fucking employees don't want to come to work At the end of the day that was some shit you should have said you should have kept yourself That's some shit you should have sent a group chat. That's some shit whatever if you if you genuinely felt like that Gee me Bro saying nigga is no is no excuse. It's nothing. I need it's just no excuse. I'll say niggas Exactly just you know, I'm glad it out cut cut that off a cavity just stop saying it I don't go for what you feel you went through who you grew up with I don't care matter that into the into the niggas that let him say that shit or let him time to fuck up exactly I need to tie my fucker You're on some boo scared that nigga.

What is you trying to bring up a conversation for when we are already in one? We already had some shit Yeah, I'm saying sure and then some of my people Pulling out that fines man do something bro. You know, I did a detri feelings to that's New York if you just punch up on somebody called you a goddamn nigga Do something If you and I ain't got a lot of bro like I can't really say how I will react until I'm in that situation But if I seen somebody saying I can't breathe, right? Like I'm gonna do my best to try to help them intervene at least push it You could push the cop real fast or something Extra breath for sure. Yeah, you know I'm saying that extra breath could have made made up for everything that extra That's gonna save us like exactly we never know exactly. We probably wouldn't be here So it's just like man. We wouldn't be here talking about this shit. Yeah, that's all we got it We got to do better as a people man. We got a really really stand together. We got a really it kind of just be no You know I'm saying like bro. We need to make our our fashion designers cool We need to make our shoe people who make shoes cool. It ain't no our business is cool our business is cool Like we need to start having you know how people be having But that's why that's why that's why I'm from the jump from the jump from the first episode I always been support black business every time I get somebody on here what black businesses do you support outside of yourself? You know I'm saying cuz we already support you on the platform. All right, so That's why we need to have like you know, I next have bridal showers and baby showers We need to have business hours. Mm-hmm. We congratulate the next business coming up. That's about to be birthed out We bought the you know, we we showing our we giving them a flowers We appreciate you we we celebrating you we you know I'm saying we need to really start being on that as a as a community All right, because within ourselves bro like I mean, I'm glad a lot of people find out about black Wall Street Nah, like niggas was already hip and jack like that, but it's like it was a real community that had no outside influence Or no outside. They didn't need nobody for nothing. We had libraries. We have host office. We have movies We had businesses we had haircuts. We had everything that you could possibly need to be a civilization And they had it and they got bombed because they didn't need no help It's like damn these niggas is super niggas. Right. You know I'm saying right so Instead of being Detroit villain be a motherfucking super niggas be be what you supposed to be support So support the black dollar And then I know a lot of people be like well black business is not professional Keep fucking with them help them to get professional interact with them so that they learn that customer service interact with them And you know I'm saying sometimes sometimes you got a chest-toes people put them to elevate for them to grow So all that over they not professional They learning help them learn the experience of them fucking your order up and I'm and I know niggas already know niggas I'll be like wow, I want my shit fucker, but the experience that I'm fucking your order up is gonna help the next ten orders Mm-hmm be put together and granted you shouldn't have to But it's still okay. Communication goes along with exactly and if you Learn especially when a black business is trying to become a Establishment exactly big ass corporation a big ass. That's a big ass that you can't but you can easily tell somebody like a man I Ain't appreciate the delay on my product or because from a service wasn't the best and I'm black and I'm Supporting you step it up tighten up. You know, I'm saying and we should be able to grow from that But don't don't be on some I'm in a shop with them. No, that's what I'm saying How many times you think you'll go to sex today nigga, they won't look at you because you're black exactly you got to tell Come here. I don't try to get enough, but you're not but you're not not shopping I'm not going to sex you about to go. You better still shop exactly as soon as you get your little cheese We gotta make we gotta make our we gotta make our product sweet. We got to make our shopping with us brokers. I'm telling exactly you got to uplift our designers our entrepreneurs our creatives our artists are right everything right our writers our authors are Anything everything everything white people do we can do we already do it We already that but we don't support we don't support each other. We don't support each other as much as we should We got to support black business support black causes Support what's going on don't be all I don't give a fuck that it like they had the end of the day You're black. This is your cause you might sit on your couch and watch other people fight failed calls But you still need to support that mom big facts. Yes, I don't mind be the biggest facts of the whole part Still need to support that mom fucker. It don't matter what it don't matter what you're not gonna do nothing support the people that They are doing something and I feel like y'all individual positive Interactions with police officers do not outweigh the fucking systematic racism that be going on It's just be like all cops not like that or like broke it. We're not talking about that right now Right. You know I'm saying that shit to me. That's going shit, too And I said thing everybody keep bringing up these conversations that don't fucking matter. I hate that But I hate that but I hate you okay you came in con you came in a contact with one fucking 300 exactly like nigga you gonna bring up that one time Niggas getting cute me on his neck, but you gonna bring a one-time But that you had that whole I mean that little interaction exactly okay What about the rest of these niggas who never gonna see that family again exactly family member again cuz nigga It's a whole bunch more ho ask cops and I seen like another post I was saying like Nega when one teacher get caught with some pedophile shit all our teachers don't come together like no We're all the same we need to stick up for each other. It's like shit Police not like that. Let's be like no, it's like we're all blue Line bro, okay, we're not and visual if Nick Cannon didn't come up with shit He came on one bad one so one bad one song He sent it to my little thing still real like no one bad one song real and I think and I think about it is bro The reason why I'm like alright, bro We got to do podcast and we got a shed light on some shit and talk about some shit first of all no a lot of people don't Expect me and you to be sitting here talking about this for one but to before anything I'm a father At any time a black father a black father a black father with a business and with a black son What you know my son, but That at any time that could have been catered and broke At any time Trayvon Martin everything that happened to the you know Eric Garner like the younger Younger kids that could be my son that could literally be catered at any time, bro Big thanks when he go to school he get out of school. You know I'm saying Anything could happen to him. So that's why it had harder And I feel like I got to speak on it or I got a shed light on it. That's because This is my life Just just hide just hide that mama and daddy Lost a son that could be me. You know that could be me and Katie's mom at any time But police could profile him at any time and not and not it ain't no telling what they they might fuck around and kill them a little four-year-old Can't it can be at the wrong place at the wrong time. You know I'm saying Detroit police just killed the four-year-old during a raid Yeah, well, yeah, what they just do it, but The point it happened, you know I'm saying yeah, so That's why I said that's why I feel like it's my duty to Step out say something use my platform the little listeners I do God You know convenient my supporters shit like that Yeah, Wendy's donated over $400,000. I'm saying that yeah Wendy's Taco Bell a bunch of shit I ain't gonna lie. Oh, yeah, that's another thing everybody go out and vote here because we can't come on now All that big t shit order that shit funny. That's to me. That's not funny though But come on bro. I mean I get it. We can't have that money though I think it cannot be he shouldn't been in there in the first place, but he for sure can't be in there But honestly though, I can't say this Now no Trump was not like Donald Trump did not win the popular vote people who did that thing it did vote and they try to get Hillary in there The electoral college is what got that nigga. So so this is what I want to say on the voting thing A lot of people think the presidential election is the biggest one, but that's not true It's the ones under that You don't have a baby together. I didn't know he was in this video though, but but um yeah, like the The primary elections is not the ones that's the biggest like you know I'm saying like they don't they don't emphasize Or to go vote for the Congress woman the Congress man the the state officials You know saying those are the people who actually in argue on your right there Those are the ones that's actually in the capital. That's the ones that you push him bills through you definitely need to vote for the presidential election but the The other elections you need to vote on as well as the ones that matter as well, you know I'm saying Because when it's when it's the whole Senate or the whole cabinet is Republicans and a veto every law that the Democrats put push through That's why it's such a schism within the politics because niggas ain't but niggas only going to vote for the president Right that's gonna do something. No gotta vote for you got a vote for the whole fucking government start from the little niggas to the big niggas And fuck before you go I got let y'all talk Pacolito is Bro give me the Amazon He's not ready for that bro niggas can't sit two hours through a movie that only got about seven long He's not ready for that's all visuals niggas not ready for that's all When that when that shit came out and we was watching it bro. It was because of the action and shit No, I like the vibe on that though. I'm next to I'm check where Puff That shit was sweet as hell nowadays niggas not by the watch it. I'm watching this Then when actually came out was a different time. Yeah for sure But even in a brand a lot of but even in like the only two people I know who fucked with that That was me other than me was you and just Seems to fuck with a pocket look that's like that bitch a classic It's a hit it's type of negative fuck with a pocket. It's a long. It's a long. If you like that movie. I fuck with you Let me get the Amazon problem. So I could watch that. She might have said Stephen right now. I need to watch that shit That should have changed out. I'll look on life. What about what about that movie change? Um cuz that shit didn't change know There's a good-ass movie that's what you think. Yeah, like what you think it was about it was about a nigga saving his family Right, he had to get a nigga nigga the colonization and shit, but like that shit really happened. What do you mean? Right, but it didn't change my all-a-gon Mine it wasn't just a story. That's all I'm actually what did it? I just told you like they got me inside on nigga. What happened bro? Like nigga. What happened? Before I educated you it didn't change our life to change our perspective. It's a change our life What do you mean? So what did it change your perspective on nigga? What happened before niggas was on shit? Like maybe for a Christian for Columbus because that nigga came at the end of the day And it was a boat nigga with the cross on it and shit niggas wasn't on that shit Make it his hollow life of his hallway of lit nigga It'd be if they never would have came over here We don't know what the fuck we're real real real like Mexican historian say that that movie was very Bullshit they say it was racist and all that shit. Yeah, but me but that's what that's what that's what that's what it's from Like the Mayans and the Aztecs is like like Mexican, you know I mean I wasn't I wasn't going extremely into you know the rituals and shit that they was doing I'm not saying that the Native American life because like what happened here happened here like you know what I'm saying so That your whole way of life was different like you hunting animals and shit. I think that shit was real You got family you got huts villages that shit real somebody came in that bitch Line niggas the fuck up. This is what I got this what I got from the movie If I did learn something I learned that you got to protect your fucking family at all costs like that nigga turned into the That nigga turned into a beast and got the niggas up out of there What a beast came out of him whatever the fuck you gonna say the beast came out of that nigga who's the most I was thinking that movie Jack where Paul for sure is that a bitch, bro. How I think a bitch was in the hall of the little puddle She pushed a baby out. Oh, yeah, okay Okay, I thought that she wasn't the most I was doing anyway, she pushed a baby on her pussy nigga and kept going with life. She had no choice Doing it wasn't it wasn't like now everything more modernize back then that was the A chillin up back then oh I gotta push this baby out. Oh, whatever I'm saying she pushed up bitch. I'll have a little nigga on her back I give her that had the baby in the hand like it was a football. I give her that she was she was a strong woman But She kept her head up, I give her that but bro, but bro was the beast of the movie Thone around and then that monster came I think I got them instincts and they can start making them little contraptions and They had got stabbed up. I think I ran a Jaguar He out ran a Jaguar and then he was a Jaguar to get the other niggas The movie had a lot of symbolism in it and I got I got like way more I haven't seen it in a minute because I still didn't watch it But it definitely wasn't just what meets the surface like it wasn't just like what you saw is what you get Like it's a whole lot of hitting gems all type of shit in there Speaking of hitting gems the movie on Netflix called uncut Jim's that's the worst movie It's not the worst ever watch it's not the worst movie to ever watch ever watch What was so bad about it with that movie had no plot? The plot the what you mean the plot was him trying to first of all it was just a whole bunch of nothing that's happening It wasn't no exactly that was the plot the plot was the anxiety that the that the story brought you the whole fucking time I feel like that's what you got out of it. I did that is what I got That was every minute every minute this nigga was trying to he was trying to bust a jug for next somebody or something And it wasn't coming through and then when it finally came through he got killed Like basically they sound like you live your life trying to do all this shit and at the end this is what you get So what was the uncut Jim? The uncut Jim was that little thing that he was trying to get from Kevin Garnet You just made it seem like it was figurative like you make your whole life to this and it's like all right I'm gonna drop it I'm gonna I'm explaining the plot of the other fucking movie and what I got from it But the uncut Jim was that little thing I kept trying to sail in the auction. I got that that he gave Kevin Durant I'm saying Kevin Garnet That movie I mean y'all can watch it y'all can be the the view I mean watch the fucking movie the end there. I will say the end of the movie was sucked The end of was bullshit. I wanted more for that. They got the end. I wanted more for the movie I didn't expect the end there. I thought I'm always gonna hang a lot I wasn't gonna see that movie because the weekend was in it not gonna cap get Coach one I Want to see I thought bro is gonna be acting I didn't know it was gonna be it. It is at It was been a weekend. He was being self in that bitch In the movies you were acting no, you were acting like your titles and said ask himself No, when you're acting like you get a hole nigga Drake was not Jimmy from so you thought that nigga had a part Yeah, I thought he was acting in a movie nigga I didn't know nigga that like nigga the weekend in the movie. I'm a bit the movie came out long It's I mean I'm not came out, but it was made as long as fuck. It had to be it was we can tell it was made Long as a fuck ago and then 24 productions or whatever just got the clearance I don't I don't know whatever. I don't know how movies work, but whatever there is they just got to go That's true. They should have not got to go They could have kept up and then I and then since they waited so long to put it out I kind of helped with making it look like a whole older, you know Like the story take place back in the day during the Boston Celtics finals or whatever when they won the ring This was lying. You think I was lying? I like how they included the sport. I like sports movies So I like how they include the sports I like how they included that bro was betting on all these games and they actually bought an NBA player in and basically basically they was trying to say like Kevin Garnet only won because of that because of that jump because of the uncle Jim, right? Whatever you whatever they call it. Why? What else you're watching on Netflix? Yeah, Jeff Epstein filthy rich. I'm watching at that I'm watching I get home. Why people are sick as fuck? I'm watching that shit is some of the sick but I ain't a lot like documentaries It's like I know about to turn it off like they don't miss you just so sick and disgusting and shit So I'm watching it to see like, you know the exact story what happened this shit, but it's just like That's that got to be a fucked up place to be at in your head that you want to fuck with little ass kids Yeah, that's just that's a mental illness. That's some sick demonic shit in my opinion You know, you know right from wrong you're tormented and you know right from wrong period They need to cut niggas dick so who do shit like yeah for cuz just cuz just cuz I might want to kill a nigga That don't mean I'm about to go kill a nigga So just cuz you think a fucking 14 year old you should attract it 14 You know that that's wrong and that you don't need to be touching her. I was like at least for you don't need to write That's the thing you will you will be touching her. You know, you know, you know be be raped and hurt none of that shit That shit's weird, you know what the fuck right from wrong is Which you think about billion so far I like being za had turned off Cuz I wasn't in the right Space to watch that shit like I'll be happen to be in the right.

      "{'transcript': \" Hey, you click play and I want to welcome you back to Season 2 Episode 68 which I'm calling the Racial War. This is your host Hannah Salazar or known as the advice from Hannah Show. And I'm super glad that I'm able to express myself in this matter if you've been writing with me for a minute or two. Like I know some of you have, you know that my preferred method of expressing my feelings and my emotions is via the podcast. So if you haven't yet subscribed, we're available on iTunes, SoundCloud, Google Play, Spotify, all the platforms, all the major podcast platforms. If you want to say what up to me, hit me up on the Instagram which is advice from Hannah or send me a quick email at advicefromhannah@gmail.com. But you guys ready? Let's go. So if you've turned on the news, you know that we have two major world issues happening right now. One of them being COVID-19, the global pandemic that has locked me in my room for the last three months and I haven't been able to go outside. But we're not here to talk about that. We are here to talk about BLM Black Lives Matter, what is happening right now with the racial war, political war in the US and around the world. I've been asked several times on the Instagram platform to go on Instagram Lives and talk about different issues with my friends and I've totally enjoyed all of that. But if you know me, I have to come on here and save my peace as well. I just want to give a quick shout out to everybody that's been collabing with me and reaching out to having these conversations. I really appreciate just a simple thought of being known as somebody that could speak about the subject. I'm not a race expert by all means, but I do lead from the heart and I speak about my own experiences. If you haven't known or if this is the first time that you're listening to me, I was born in the Dominican Republic. I probably say that all the time. But when I came to Canada at five, the Black community rejoiced me, opened their arms, played with me, everything. I enjoyed their music, their food, their culture. I've been to their houses. I've been to their events. And it's just something that has been so much love and out port. I actually considered myself an Afro-Latina because if you see me, you know, how I look like so I hold hand in hand with the Black community. I identify myself as an Afro-Latina and of somebody who constantly receives so much love from the Black community. It is outpouring sometimes. And I'm here to talk about this in the most positive manner. I myself haven't experienced any sort of police brutality or race-like racial slurs set to my face, but I have been in rooms where this has been the norm. And I've stayed quiet in a sense. I've seen, and I'm not part of that, but I'm admitting it, right? And I'm not going to let that happen again. And I've seen so many opportunities of my friends just be passed up because of their color of their skin, especially after having all these conversations. I do understand more and more how the Black community has been oppressed for over 400 years, so much talent, so much, you know, love and art that comes from the Black community and society has oppressed them. And I'm really not going to stand for it anymore, I think. And I've become a person over the last year. I'm a cheerleader. If you don't know me, I back up a lot of projects. I am in the behind the scenes. I'm supporting, and I'm giving strategies and letting people know in a sense how to go by when they're doing something new and how to establish themselves online. 90% of the people I work with are people of color. Without a doubt. Hands down. I choose to work with people that look like me because I understand the struggle and the mindset not to say that I don't work with other cultures because I do. But they are the ones that hold a near and dear place in my heart. I'm super saddened by everything that I see online of how many people are afraid to speak out and talk about how they feel and talk about how they view things because they're scared of judgment because they're scared of maybe their work is going to be, you know, taken from them or they're not going to be able to succeed or surpass any sort of adversity if they really show how they're feeling at that given moment. So I'm going to talk to you guys a little bit and I want to kind of. I have this thing online that I've been referencing to because so many people have asked me to come use my voice and I will always use my voice for change. I will always use my voice to champion people and cheer them on. I will use my voice when things aren't right. I will use my voice whenever the I feel like it. So I don't have a problem talking about the super hard subjects because I do it every single week on this podcast. So if you want to, you know, have a conversation about race and how opportunities are taken from my friends left, friend and center and you think that's not true. Look, I've got stories for you. So there are some in the ecosystem, there's seven types of change that can happen with somebody, right? So I was looking online the other day and I stumbled across this and I thought it was super super super cool and like everybody has a role in social change, right? So they're the weavers. So they see the lines of connectivity between people, places, organizations and ideas, the experimenters, they, they're pioneers of things. So the experimenters, they take risk and course, correct as needed. The frontline responders are the people that are organizing the resources, aiding communities. Their visionaries imagine and generate bold as possible hopes and dreams and remind others of the direction. Their builders that develop and implement ideas, practices and people, their caregivers, the nurture and nourish people around them to create the change. There's the structure that the ones that take uncomfortable risky actions to shake up the status quo. They're healers and they recognize intent to generational current traumas by oppressive systems. They're storytellers. They craft and share community stories and experiences through possibility of arts, for board media and movement and their guides. They teach counsel, advise, use, gifts and well-earned wisdom. So I kind of went through that pretty quickly, but I want to let you know that these are just one of the resources that I found online that I thought was super useful of the seven different, not seven or nine, nine, wait, I can't count. Y'all know I can't count. One, two, three, four, five, ten different titles of people that can make social change in your ecosystem. So if you're sitting at home right now and you see everything that's happening with Black Lives Matter, which the police brutality and you think that the only way that you can make difference is by, you know, marching, throwing riots or things like that, what the media portrays, there's ten different ways for you to create change within your own community. I'm somebody that's been a huge advocate of that. Yes, I have this platform. Yes, I'm a broadcaster. Yes, people ask me to come on to their networks and speak greatness to their audience. However, that's my vocation, right? I'm a visionary. I see people working together in the future. I see partnerships and opportunities and stages being shared by all my colleagues. That's what I see and I strive and I push for it as much as I can. But necessarily, that may not be your jam, man. And if that's not what you think is right for you at this moment, don't force it because I strongly believe that a lot of things don't pan out because you're not leading through your natural intuition. We're trying to do things that we're not meant to do and therefore we're not being successful. So whatever it is that you feel in your heart that you're supposed to be doing during this time, that's what you need to do. Whether it's you're nurturing the people in your community, whether it's that you're still storytelling, whether you're at the front lines, whether you're visionary, whether you're weaving things together. Whatever motion it is that you're supposed to be doing. Stick to that because not everybody is meant to be at the forefront of change, that everybody is meant to grab a microphone. I know it looks glamorous, but sometimes there's other work that needs to be done in the back end of things to make the change makers and to make everybody that's revolutionary right now still work. So I wanted to say that because this is my platform to say whatever I want, but I really wanted to stress upon that yes, you have a chance to make an impact in your community and make an impact on what you want to see done, but you have to do this in your own way. Not everybody can do the exact same thing and you have to lead with your heart and lead with intention. I know a lot of us are scared or we fear that we'll be judged and guess what? You are going to be judged. Guess what? You're still going to have to do it scared. So I want you to level up in a sense and just go do what your heart desires. I also, I touched a really cool point while I was talking to my friend Don, part of the man, if you guys don't follow him, you definitely should shout out to Don. Thanks so much for the intuitive combo the other day. But you know, a big part of that is education. A huge part of the fact that we're scared to talk up when we're in a room and we see our people of color or black community being mistreated is we don't want to speak up because we lack education because we don't know how to speak up because we're scared that our accents or our slang or the way we show up is going to be harshly judged. And to be honest, in my personal opinion here, I'm very open-minded. I don't judge by what somebody looks like or how they talk. I talk about, I judge them how they make me feel. That's like the biggest guide that I choose to navigate with, how somebody makes me feel when I'm with them. But you know, education is the key. I know a lot of us went to college and you know, if you're in the 30 plus age group, which I'm not, we haven't been in school in a while and we haven't picked up any sort of formal education in a while. And Angelica Lamb, who's also somebody I look up to, she's always preaching to go to business school and get your masters or Donald saying, you know, go sign up for a course or start taking night courses or anything because the only way that we can combat this is through education. If we're smarter, not smarter. If we have enough knowledge gained by reading, by going to school, by attending groups, by attending seminars, by attending workshops, if we're educated enough, we will be silenced because we'll now have the same tools that everybody else in the room has. I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say that white privilege doesn't exist because it exists. I've seen it. I've seen it right in front of my eyes, not to say that we can't partner and you know, hold hands with white privilege and, and you know, take that, that and like raise it up even higher together. That's a conversation for another day. But the only difference sometimes is the education. Work ethic is there. I think when work till the dogs come home, I can work 12, 18 hour days. I do it every single day and I can outwork anybody. But at the end of it all, I can put in the work and I can do everything. If somebody with their shiny, you know, piece of paper will be able to get into a corporate room and seal a deal. Not to say that I can't do it, but it would just take me longer to do so. And mind you, I have a bachelor's degree in business. So that, but I'm talking about the higher rooms and the higher conversations, right? So we shouldn't back away from learning more. There's so many, I see so many programs right now and it's looking way more diverse and with people of color than it did when I was in college five, six years ago. So it's definitely something that I like to preach, which is education. It's something that if you're listening to me in the northern side of the hemisphere, it's pretty accessible with all the grants and scholarships and the things that people are getting themselves into. It's no longer as unattainable. I like to think as it once was because we're now opening our minds. You know, if you look at the greatest leaders in life, they're super educated. And if this is something that you want to combat, we have to do this with smarts. Yes, we can be street smart, but we have to have the book smarts. I've heard it time and time again. There is, you know, work in silence, even if you're going to school at night, even if you're taking one course and it's going to take you eight years to get your master's, whatever the case may be, I suggest for you to start and to start now because the only way we're going to get ahead is by educating ourselves. And if we can't educate ourselves by ourselves, then we grab a group of people and we work together and we all learn together to rise together because that's the only way I find that we're going to combat this racial war is by having more education. It's by reading war. It's by working together and it's by leading with a lot, a lot of love and having the tough conversations, not only online, but offline and being alleys and creating genuine two-way partnerships with people and really elevating your community. That's kind of what I want to do. I am definitely looking more and more into furthering my education and being able to share all my platforms with whoever wants to share them with me if and so you're ready to do it. By all means, this is just me expressing how I feel. I really want everybody to feel comfortable and happy when they're about to start something and that they're not doing it because I told them to. As always, I want to thank you so very much for listening to me. I don't take your listens for granted. I myself struggle with the consistency of this podcast, but just to know that at least one person that's listening to me right now is actually resonating with what I'm saying. It makes all my sleepless nights and anxiety-written stress and everything else that I experience totally worth it. What are we going to do? We're going to find out which 10 of the things of the ecosystems that we fit under, which like roll. We're going to start getting more educated. We're going to lead with love. We're going to hand hold. We're going to collaborate and we're going to demand the spots that we deserve or if not create them. As always, this is your favorite host, Advaiti Kincana, coming at you from her bedroom studio in Toronto and I want to wish you the best week ever. Two dolls.

(upbeat music) - Like everything is personality dripping. It\\'s all personality dripping. You know what I\\'m saying? That\\'s why people love Charlotte Me. - Like, \\'cause he don\\'t really need a script as much as he could just be Charlemagne every day. It\\'s like, and he\\'s just Charlemagne based on whatever they talk about. He\\'s gonna be the same Charlemagne. - Exactly. - Okay. - Okay, now I\\'m trying to be like, I\\'m trying to be at the corner of the wall. I think I\\'ll be thinking about it. - That\\'s why I don\\'t wanna know. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - Well, you end up like a Marlon Wayne state dude. You know, like Marlon Wayne\\'s, you could tell has a blueprint for what he wants to be. He just OD\\'s on it. Like, you know what? That\\'s just too much of all of that. Like, he\\'s dang, you know what it is? Marlon Wayne\\'s, you could tell, \"Who are watching Daniel Wayne\\'s?\" - Yeah. - Well, I\\'m gonna be my brother, but extra. And then it\\'s like, no, now it\\'s too much. We don\\'t want you at all. Like, like, know my wife and kids sit calm for you. You stay on WB. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - So what\\'s going on, brother? - What\\'s happening, my man? - You know what I\\'m saying? - You know what I\\'m saying? - I\\'m gonna be like, \"What\\'s going on, man? You\\'ve been getting great reviews out here on these streets. I\\'m by spending a little bit jealous. Nobody hit me like, \"Y\\'all like you on the podcast?\" (laughing) - Listen, man. I love it. - I love it. - I love it. - I love reviews. I don\\'t like male reviews, but I like reviews. - You know what I\\'m saying? - I love reviews. See, that went over your head, brother, male reviews. - No, I know exactly what you\\'re talking about. - I know exactly what you\\'re talking about. - I know what you\\'re talking about. I didn\\'t let the law, I let the attorney. - You cosigned with solace. You\\'re like, \"I like me.\" - Nah, nah, nah. I was like, \"You gon talk about me.\" - You gon talk, yeah? - You can like what you like, man. It\\'s so good, brother. - I mean, I can\\'t like me. - I left you try to live my truth, but you know, in my truth, I don\\'t like male reviews. (laughing) My truth. I don\\'t like male reviews, yeah. - You don\\'t like me? - I mean, there you go, R-E-B-E-E. - U-E-E-E-E. - Yeah, you ain\\'t yet. - Yeah, that\\'s not my thing, but you know what I\\'m saying? That\\'s people\\'s thing, that\\'s the thing that\\'s not me. - That\\'s the thing, man, listen. It\\'s in business for a reason, brother. - Exactly, everybody got it all right, man. - Yes, sir. - That\\'s one of my catchphrase and all what? I gotta start putting that on some rope just something on the A-Y-Y-Y. - What\\'s that? Everybody got to live their own life? - Yup. - What you gonna put that on the water bottle? - Maybe a water bottle might do some cloth pampers, knife-ers, you know what I\\'m saying? - Everybody got to live their own life. - You get to like some baby tees? - On pampers, are you gonna put it on the front of the back? Either way, it\\'s the law. It\\'s not right, either way. - Yeah, maybe there\\'s a onesie. - Yeah, it\\'s not right. - Yeah. - You watched nine and 10, did you watch any of the other ones? - No. - No, okay, so what\\'d you think about that? - I mean, look, I did what I came across. There\\'s one thing I can take away from the last episodes, right? So a lot of people wanna, like there\\'s a lot of things in life that we feel we can\\'t do because we don\\'t have certain advantages, right? Like, if you try out for the, and if you think you\\'re gonna make the NBA, but then you see dudes dunking like Mike or Scotty Pippin\\' 6\\'7 with a handle, right? You go, you know what? Nah, it\\'s not for me. I\\'m just not gifted, right? But I\\'m here to tell you, you\\'re just not nice enough. You know why? Stockton, I think I can be stocked in any type of Olympic competition, right? Like, you have a 40 yard dash, like a vertical leap, like, stocked in, I don\\'t think he jumped. Is Stockton jumped when he played? - Mm-hmm. - Stockton might be the best WNBA player of all time. - Because he really, he never jumped. He never, he literally just played fundamental basketball. That\\'s it. He had no special athletic ability. He had no special one attribute that was a kill, but he is. Like, like, that\\'s what I took away from it. - Nah, I\\'m gonna push back on you a little bit though. I think, I realized that Stockton and all those dudes, like, they don\\'t look nice, they can\\'t compare us into, well, he was nice. I mean-- - No, Stockton was nice, but the same is, it wasn\\'t based off of no athletic attributes. It was just pure-- - You\\'re pure, I got you, yeah. - You\\'re on skill, like, if you are skilled at the highest level, there\\'s a place for you. - Got you. Now, what I\\'m gonna say, all right, so, for my point was gonna be, but you kinda re-freered your point. My point was gonna be that he didn\\'t look nice in comparison to the nicest of the nicest of the nicest. You know what I\\'m saying? So, like, if you wanna run a regular court, you\\'re gonna kill everybody. If you\\'re pulling in a regular Y? - He is, because he has skill. - But can he beat you in a 40-yard dash? - Nah, probably not, I\\'m not that-- - But you moved into John Stockton in an arm wrestling contest, son. - Nah, probably. - But there\\'s no athletic attributes that are above average to the common man, none. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no. - No, he\\'s not fast. - No way, his problems are picking some videos of him dunking all YouTube, I like to say. - No, no. - No, son, his jump shots, he literally jumped, like maybe six inches off the ground with his jump shots. - Yeah. - You literally-- - I don\\'t think you\\'re playing today\\'s in the theater. - You know what, everybody keeps saying that, like, there\\'s-- - When his skill set, as we knew it existed. - Why can\\'t he? Like, are they aliens now? Like, new-- - Nah, nah, nah, nah. - You guys, listen to me, after, as his skill set, as we know it existed, they won\\'t play it at, that is mad basic in the league right now. - With, no, no, no, no, he\\'s not basic. He just has no athletic ability. - Yo, downstock, don\\'t wanna talk to people over, not like that. - That\\'s right, but no, no, no, no, no. That doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t have the ability to, like, if you ain\\'t never see people try to press them full court. - Yeah. - So that doesn\\'t mean he didn\\'t, I\\'m not gonna go off the skill. I\\'m going off an athletic ability. I\\'m saying he\\'s not an athlete. There\\'s only one guy-- - Name, name, one non-athlete in the NBA right now. - Steph Curry. - Yup. - Uh, yup. - Name two, if you\\'re another one. (laughing) - That\\'s all you need, son. - That\\'s what you need. Steph Curry, that\\'s it. That\\'s my example, I\\'m not naming two. - I decline. (laughing) - Why I\\'m naming two, I name two. - I\\'m gonna say, well, I\\'m gonna say, why Steph Curry is, well, John Sfeiten has exceptional too, but Steph Curry is a senator, but this three-point shot was crazy. - Nope, what I\\'m saying is, that\\'s a skill. He\\'s not the zero athletic ability in that man. - Yo, whatever you at right now, stay where you at, \\'cause the audio sound great, like, right now. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, I can\\'t see myself. Like, Steph Curry is a pure example of hard work pays off, that\\'s it. - Yeah, I got you. - Yeah, no hard work. - You think Kyrie has a little bit of athleticism. I\\'m trying to think of someone that\\'s literally in a league, that\\'s just a regular dude, that if he didn\\'t play basketball, like, again, if you saw him at the gym, like, do you think Steph can bench 225? - I\\'m gonna say no, based on what I\\'m looking at, and I\\'m basically saying no. - Right, a professional athlete that makes money playing sports for a living that cannot bench 225, is just purely a skill player. So that\\'s it. - John Stockton? - Steph, John Stockton could have played in today\\'s NBA. That\\'s it. If Steph Curry can, I\\'m not saying John Stockton is as nice as Steph Curry. How did, wait, you really trying to say John Stockton could have played in the NBA? He would start for the next two days. - No, I\\'m not. I\\'m not gonna say he couldn\\'t play \\'cause all the top guys from that era could play in NBA. I don\\'t think they would be a top guy though. Like, you know what I\\'m saying? Like, he wouldn\\'t be Jordan. Like, Jordan would be a top guy no matter whatever he played in. And I\\'m saying it\\'s certain players that I think they would be the top guys no matter the era, like Jordan, LeBron, who was from the 80s though, that I think, I think Dominique would be a top player. When you say you don\\'t like Dominique, \\'cause Dominique is trash. - I didn\\'t, come on, but we gotta stop, man. Like, you were 10 years old and you saw that 360 dunk, you got hype. You can\\'t tell me what is Dominique good at? Tell me one thing he\\'s good at outside of the team. - He\\'s a rebounder. (laughs) He\\'s not a good rebounder. - Hey, yeah. - Did you understand he was like a double double guy, yeah? - What? Was it Dominique a double double guy? - No, see, there we go. We\\'re done, that\\'s it. You got, he is not a double double guy. - You sure, yo? - I\\'m about to look it up. We got the internet right now. - I\\'m positive. He wasn\\'t a double double. Who do you think, I didn\\'t say Moses Malone? He said Dominique Wilkins, man. I guarantee he didn\\'t have every seven rebounds. Not only-- - Dominique Wilkins, double double C. This proves my point. Nobody under the age of 30, if you were under 30 when that person played, I can\\'t take your opinion on it. \\'Cause now Dominique is a double double guy. Dominique Wilkins, no. What you got? What was his-- - Are you right? - You\\'re right, yo. - He\\'s 25, seven and two. - Yeah, double double two. Dominique was not nice. - Yeah, 2% 2.5, 2% correct. - The funny thing is-- - So he did, one year he came to 25 and nine though. - One year. - Oh, so close. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - But, there you go. That proves my point, man. These guys, Dominique, Dominique, all these guys we remember growing up. It\\'s like that video game that-- - Yo, Dominique played a long time, bro. I didn\\'t realize that. - Well, how long? - He played for like, looks like 16 years. No, he played, and he played professional 16 years. He played in the NBA for 14 years. - Yeah, that don\\'t count. 14 years is-- - Nah, nah, I\\'m moving that 12, 13, 14, 15. 16 years, yo, he played 16 years, son. That\\'s a long time. - Yeah, no, that is. Depends on your meados, you a starter, but-- - Nah, he started off most of them years. He started, what\\'s that last season? What team is he on for that last season? - He started last season. He was 39 years old. He played for Orlando. He didn\\'t start that. He didn\\'t start that year. But he started basically, I guess he started getting hurt. He didn\\'t play a post-war full season after his 34th. So what year is this? - I guess this is 11 seasons in a year. He didn\\'t play, well, he didn\\'t after that. That was the same, like, when I started most of the career, he started damn near his whole career until-- - He\\'s not nice. - 13, 13th year. Nah, he was nice, man. We can\\'t have a really disagreeing that. How many-- - Listen, again, nice is just your criteria for nice. So let me bring up who else was nice. Was Joe Dumar\\'s nice? - Joe Dumar\\'s. I didn\\'t say he was nice, but he was-- - But Dominique was nice. - Good, yeah, he was good. Joe Dumar\\'s is good, though. - Isaiah Thomas, was he nice? - Yeah, Isaiah Thomas was nice, yeah. - Was Alonzo mourning nice? - Alonzo, before the issues, the heart issues and all that, yes, he was nice. - Yeah, not the hospital Alonzo mourning. Not after the hospital. (laughing) - Alonzo in the hospital, he was all right. He moves kinda slow, but that Alonzo before. All right, so who else is nice? So now I get it, your criteria for nice is different than mine. - So what\\'s your-- - No, hold it. - Let\\'s get clarity on that. What\\'s your-- - Wait, hold on, was Vin Baker nice? - I don\\'t move in Baker that much. - He\\'s after Dominique. - Yeah, I don\\'t move in-- - I remember him, but I don\\'t remember seeing him play like that, I can\\'t-- Is Powell, is Powell good, Saul nice? - Nah, he\\'s good though. - But Dominique is nice. - Dominique is nice, yeah. - Carmelo nice? - Carmelo, Carmelo, on the office of his name, he\\'s nice. - There\\'s nothing Dominique can do better than Carmelo. Nothing. - You grew up with my point though. - Yeah, but you just said Carmelo\\'s-- - No, wait, is it Carmelo\\'s name-- - I just did it on the office of Vin. - So Carmelo, nice to you. - No, I just said Dominique is your benchmark. That\\'s your-- - Nah, that\\'s not my best. - That\\'s your main goal. Is that your Mendoza line, like in baseball, like is that your threshold for, like if you better than Dominique, you\\'re nice. If you\\'re-- - Nah, I never thought about basketball, and I\\'m gonna say if you better than such, it\\'s nice, I\\'m just saying he\\'s nice. - Dominique doesn\\'t make my nice. Dominique makes my-- - What\\'s your definition of knife? Let\\'s get clarity on that. What\\'s your definition of-- - The definition of knife is you take Dominique Wilkins-- - Nah, nah, no, you know they-- - Okay, hold on, what is it? If you\\'re better than him, you\\'re nice. He\\'s my benchmark, like right there. Like you can\\'t be one of those guys that put up stats and lose. Like Sharif up do a Raheem is not nice. You know what I mean? Nick Van Exel, not nice. Like guys that are scoring but losing, they\\'re not nice. So Dominique, not nice. Like Atlanta was never in those, you know it\\'s Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Lakers, and Atlanta. You\\'ve never heard of Atlanta. So if you were nice, nice like that, Charles, everyone had their time in the sun, Barkley had his little moment, Malone had his little moment. Even you and had his own moment. Do you ever remember the Nick Stink-- Oh, we gotta go through the Hawks tonight. We gotta play the Hawks. It\\'s gonna be a rough day in the field. I wonder what his career winning percentages, look that up. Look that Dominique winning percentage up. What do you get for that? - Oh no, man. Oh no. - He\\'s not nice. - Did Dominique make the, Nah, he didn\\'t make that list on a thing. - What? - 50 players list. - He might\\'ve. He might\\'ve. He\\'s not nice. Kevin Durant. - No, so give me your benchmark. So what, are you saying that play gotta be? - He has to play winning basketball. Like meaning like what he does helps teams win the end. So if you\\'re nice, because you can do stuff on a court, but it doesn\\'t really translate to winning, it doesn\\'t really make you nice. It\\'s actually-- - That goes back to, I guess we\\'re gonna talk about this a little bit. I guess we can talk about it now. That goes back to, and team sports though, that goes back to the team over. - Nah, it really doesn\\'t because at the end of the day, there are things that you can do that it doesn\\'t matter. Like, so why do certain people win no matter what team they\\'re on? And why do certain people always have that, ah, nobody, for example, right? Some guys-- - You know what I\\'m gonna tell you, I\\'m gonna tell you why, \\'cause even Jordan, right? It depends on the team and who your competition, who\\'s in front of you. But even Jordan, even the Bulls is making the playoffs in the first two seasons of Michael Jordan\\'s career, and it was a sub-500 team, y\\'all. - No, they were still only the top eight. So whether you sub-500, you still had to be-- - I\\'m saying, so what I\\'m saying to you is that it\\'s not just necessarily, oh, you winning, it\\'s based on your competition. So if you\\'re at the top eight, and it\\'s the video game is nice, you wouldn\\'t have made it. - No, that means, if I have 10 teams and six of them are evenly matched, and four of them are much better than everyone else, right? The four that are much better than everyone else are gonna beat up on everyone else, and the other six teams have to battle within each other, so they\\'re all gonna have similar records. That doesn\\'t mean that they\\'re not nice, this just means that there were other teams much, much better, right? So let\\'s take, for example, if you wanna look about these guys who always win, like LeBron, right? LeBron, no matter what team he\\'s on, he\\'s gonna find a way to at least be a competitor. He\\'s never going out in the first round of playoffs, right? Because his game allows him to transform and do whatever it takes to win. It doesn\\'t matter what team he\\'s on, right? Now you get some other guys, right? Like Dwight Howard, right? Dwight Howard, sometimes his teams are good, sometimes his teams aren\\'t good, why? \\'Cause his game is pretty much non, it doesn\\'t change, it\\'s not one of those things that can override his team being weak in order to win. Like LeBron\\'s skill set, no matter what, if he\\'s playing with scrubs, or if he\\'s playing with decent guys, he\\'s gonna try to find a way to win. \\'Cause the object of the game is to win. So if you\\'re not winning, after a few years, the way the NBA is set up, the worst team continuously gets the best draft picks. So over time, you have talent. So whether you keep that talent to do better or not, eventually it comes up to your leadership style and how you all play it. Like, you gotta eventually play winning basketball. If you\\'re doing stuff that\\'s not conducive to winning, it doesn\\'t matter. Like I say, a Thomas, right? The little Isaiah Thomas, the little one. - The new Isaiah Thomas. - The one I got. - The one I got in things spelled right. - Right. - Yeah. - Him. Like, he can score 30 points a game if you let him, but is that winning basketball? Like, are you gonna win a title with Isaiah Thomas? - I don\\'t know. But I think, I think, I think where I\\'m gonna push that, well, I think the blind spot is, is that you can pair any dudes, like, you can\\'t get spared by the LeBron, yeah. Like, we never seen LeBron ever, yeah. Nobody\\'s done with LeBron\\'s done, even Jordan, yeah. - But I\\'m talking about if you\\'re the best man on your team, right? - Yes. - And you are consistently losing. Are you really a good player? Are you nice? And you can\\'t, like, you are 20% of the team. Like, meaning basketball is like the only sport where you can have an impact, like, on offense and defense. Like, Tom Brady has to come out of the game when the players don\\'t have the ball. You know what I mean? - I know what you\\'re saying. I get what you\\'re saying. I get what you\\'re saying. So you say, \\'cause the basketball is, I mean, I don\\'t really watch baseball, but, and teams sports basketball is one of them sports where one player can definitely impact more, more greater than have a greater impact on the game than any other sport and a teams sport that I could think of. - Name a sport where you can decide I\\'m gonna score the points. In football, you can\\'t just, quarterback can\\'t just take the ball, shotgun, I\\'m like, you know what? That\\'s it, this drive, I\\'m just giving it to me. And I\\'m just running the ball every time. Like, it\\'s not gonna work. Like, in baseball, you can\\'t go, you know what? I\\'m batting first, second, and third. That\\'s it. Like, with basketball, if it\\'s crunch time, you can go, you know what, give me the ball. Everyone clear out. I\\'m gonna put the points on the board. I\\'m gonna take over. Like, you can\\'t do that in any other sport, right? - Yeah. - So if your team is losing basketball, as long as you stay with close, and now it\\'s down to one minute or whatever, if your team is consistently losing, you have something to do with that. That\\'s it. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, so Dominique\\'s not nice. - Dominique\\'s not nice. - No. - He\\'s not nice. The long way around to it. What did you take from it? What did you take from it? - Documentary, yeah, I just wanna know who is Scott Burrell\\'s parent, Joe. Like, who raised Scott Burrell, yeah. - Why? - Yo, he was, you know, Mike, maybe I can\\'t blame for all his parents, you know what I\\'m saying? \\'Cause that\\'s a certain point he got in. Well, you don\\'t see, this goes back to the conversation we had before. You don\\'t know what these, you don\\'t know, we need a last dance, the non-Michael Jordan version of the last. - Right. The non, the direct, not the non-Michael Jordan cut. - Yeah, yeah, we need that. I mean, that would never get released or would never see it. Like somebody had to do an unauthorized last dance. - But wait, what do you say about Scott Burrell? - Oh, he would just kill Scott Burrell, yo. He\\'s killed Scott Burrell for like four episodes street. - So, all right, so here\\'s my thing, right? Let\\'s say he had, what type of parents do you, what type of reaction did you and Scott Burrell to have? What did he do? - Scott Burrell to see, the standard for us up here. - Okay. So, like Scott Burrell, like I said, listen, this is Michael Jordan\\'s version, right? So maybe Scott Burrell did one thing, it was like, yo, Mike, keep talking, keep talking. I\\'m gonna put some blood in your mouth, yo. You know what I\\'m saying? - But the only, but here\\'s the thing, right? When you talk like that, and you don\\'t really feel that way, that if Michael\\'s like, all right, let\\'s do it, what\\'s up? (laughing) I mean, I just want you to stop. Please. No, you say you\\'re gonna put blood in my mouth. I wanna see you put blood in my mouth. Actually, you know what? I don\\'t you like playing basketball. You might as well start practicing pitching \\'cause you have to leave. So, and you\\'re talking about the most powerful man. You gotta remember Scott Burrell grew up with Michael Jordan being the nicest player in the league. Like, it\\'s not like Scotty and Horace Grant where they were playing at the same time, this is one of their peers. Like, he\\'s significantly younger. He grew up as a kid like, yo, that guy is nice. So, you don\\'t have to, like right now, if Warren Buffett was like, you know what? I\\'m gonna let you rock with me for the month, right? And you coming in his office like, what is wrong with you? He\\'s like, ah, damn it. Ah, what is this? What is this shoe that you\\'re wearing with this brown shoe? Where black shoe ladies? You\\'re not gonna go, Warren Buffett, yo, who puts some blood in your mouth? Warren Buffett. (laughing) You\\'re not gonna do that. Warren, good boy. No more knowledge than you. I\\'m not rocking with you, no more. You\\'re done. So, he looked at Michael Jordan, the way that you might look at Warren Buffett. Like, he used to guru. Let me just shut up. Actually, he might have done a good thing by shutting up \\'cause we know Scott Burrell\\'s name, right? Yeah. Well, I thought you forgot about Scott Burrell to documentary, beyond, so I totally forgot about him. No, but what I\\'m saying is he\\'s relevant. He\\'s relevant now, folks. He\\'s relevant in general, meaning Scott Burrell is in saying like, huh? Huh? All right, so now Mike retired, right? Do you remember that dude that replaced him? Nah, not at all. The random two guard, Pete Myers. Pete Myers, man. When Mike comes back, there\\'s no more Pete Myers, right? \\'Cause he might have come back and be like, yo, hey, what\\'s up, and right? Yo, who is this, Pete Myers? Yo, Pete, you are horrible. Like, they let you start and Pete might be like, \"You\\'re Mike, I\\'m telling you. \"You better watch your mouth.\" You\\'re mike right now, you know what? Get him up out of here. Ow, he\\'s gotta go. He\\'s gotta go. Yeah, so you don\\'t know, like Mike had a different dynamic. Like, Mike made more money than, he made more just as much if not more than the owner. Like, he was the most powerful man in the NBA. Like, you\\'re not threatening the guy. Like, the only-- Well, Steve Kerr, Steve Kerr put those hands on him, though. He got his hand put back on him, though. No, who? Who hit first? Steve Kerr, right? That\\'s his story. Mike Puss, Mike Puss, and Steve Kerr put Puss in the chest, yeah. Right, so Mike initiated, right? And how was Steve Kerr? Yeah. And how was Steve Kerr telling that story? Was he like, yeah, I had to let him know. Or was he more like, man, it was, it was an unfortunate incident. I\\'m just glad all\\'s welded and as well. Like, listen, you don\\'t remember Steve Kerr today? Post-career has accomplished more than Michael Jordan, right? Yeah, that\\'s a fact. Well-- Well, now I ain\\'t gonna say that \\'cause Michael Jordan owned the team. I think it owned the team. I think it owned the team. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Would you rather own the losing team or coach or winning championship? Which one? I think I would rather own the losing team, though. See, that\\'s the thing, because your goal is money. Steve Kerr might be like, listen, I got more than enough money than I can spend. Like, whether I have 10 million or 100 million, I\\'m good. So you know what? I wanna be a winner, see? So Steve Kerr is just, and even then, people are still talking to him deferential, like these are years ago, years, 20 years ago, and people are still deferring to Mike. So you can\\'t expect a Scott Burrell in the moment to step up to him, son. It\\'s not realistic. Like, you just gotta, it\\'s almost like Mike, Michael\\'s like, what\\'s his name? Pablo Escobar. Like, he was the big boss. Like, he can\\'t say anything to him. He gotta let him book. What would you do if you was Scott Burrell? Honestly. Now, I think of Mike, yo, Mike, yo, we had to have a conversation on this side of something, like yo, bro. But what if he did, and Michael\\'s like, no, I am gonna keep doing this. You got playing this on him, yo. We\\'re losing Troy, yeah? You got it. Now you got the league, and now your pants like you\\'re so stupid, bro. You\\'re so stupid. Like then you have, then you\\'re gonna have those parents. Yo, you could have shut up. He was retiring the next year anyway. Like, how stupid are you? You\\'re gonna hit Michael Jordan? Now you don\\'t have a, - I think, well, Mike, respect that though. He respects Steve Kerr. - You don\\'t have to respect Steve Kerr. - You don\\'t know that he respects it until after you do it. - That\\'s true. - Yeah. - Like yo, if I punch you, you\\'re gonna respect me more, right? Yes. All right, I\\'m gonna punch you now. Like he\\'s not giving you that clearance. Like, who knows? Steve, you gotta remember something else too, which is another angle that Mike was powerful because of the NBA, right? - Yeah. - But what if Scott Barrell was getting 500,000 a year from Nike? - Yeah, that\\'s true. Yeah, that\\'s what I\\'m saying. We need to see the, we need to see the, right, there\\'s too many avenues, like, Mike is cool with the owner. Mike is cool. Like, Scott Barrell calls David Stern, and they\\'re like, please, do not ever call this number again, ever. Go to the office and submit your ticket, and we will get back to you in 24 to 48 hours. Jordan can go to David Stern\\'s house, like David, what are you doing with these rules, man? I don\\'t like, you know, like, - Yeah, we need to, - We need to, we need the unauthorized version of it. - So, we need to authorize version. So, Scott Barrell, what else? What do you think about, - Oh, yeah, well, it\\'s sad, boy. Thought no trophies in the bag, yo. - Oh, these, oh, these, uh... - Yo, that\\'s a piece. - Yeah, that\\'s from, that\\'s just winnings. They\\'re not even mine from the, from the support of my kids, dude, that\\'s it. - Oh, yeah. - So, it\\'s funny. They were only reacting to my daughter, police forces, \\'cause she saw my son\\'s trophies, and then she was like, I want as many as him. She got a little way to go, but she got more, she\\'s way more for her age than he was at his age, for sure. Like, she is more, like, he is winning trophies. She is more like, MVP type trophies. - Yeah. - Yeah, exactly. - Yeah, I just saw them, \\'cause I\\'m like, yo, they\\'re doing crazy. Oh, so, oh, what, what, what about I take away from that joint? I think we got on the 10th of Scott Barrell joint. But one is like, yo, Mike is the, like I said, I don\\'t really believe in like, the Golden\\'s and Team Sports like that. I believe in the-- - That\\'s right. - Huh? - You gotta have a Golden Team\\'s sports just because-- - I think I think, I think you gotta go by errors, yeah. But I think, yeah, it has to be by errors. Like, I would, I would see the goal of an error, but not the total. - I mean, you have to remember this. My main thing is always just, how much better are you than a person who can\\'t-- - You\\'re not playing games today. - Because-- - I know, I know for you that, that\\'s what it is. I\\'m just saying for me. - Yeah, that\\'s me. Because at the end of the day, we can\\'t hit the dude. Like, if people were smoking and eating steaks, and now people are eating fruits and vegetables, and you know, getting, you know, getting trainers after every game, you have to assume that if the person from the other ever had the same resources, they would be, you know what I mean? Like, I can\\'t-- - Yeah, that\\'s why I say you gotta be error. That\\'s why I say I go by. - That\\'s me, the error, right. - Yeah. - Can\\'t assume that Will is gonna play like Will, like if Will grew up in this error, Will might be coming to red. - Yeah. Now, if I\\'m saying, that\\'s why I said you gotta go by error. Like, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, uh, conceive like a group of an error, you know what I\\'m saying? I think Michael Jordan is the, is by far the most important player of basketball ever. You know what I\\'m saying? Here\\'s my only thing, right? Let\\'s say there was no Michael Jordan, right? Let\\'s say there was no Michael Jordan. Let\\'s just assume Michael Jordan wasn\\'t in there, right? Before Michael Jordan came. Who were people saying were the best ever, right? - I think people probably was saying, probably was like a Bill Russell probably, I don\\'t know. - I don\\'t know. Let\\'s say there was no Mike, like you just never came to the league, right? - Yeah. - So now we\\'re debating, right? - Yeah. - Let\\'s, you\\'re saying LeBron is nice. Who else would you say is nice? - Would that be good? That should be in a gold conversation? - Right, like right now, if you think the other-- - I don\\'t judge players that I never saw play. So all my stuff would be like 1980, 1980, \\'85 and after really. So I would say like, like, I mean, but if there\\'s no Mike, there\\'s no Kobe, you know what I\\'m saying? So play-- - Let\\'s say, let\\'s say there was no Mike, right? - Yeah. - Now the argument would be LeBron versus who? Kobe, right? - Kobe, everybody, LeBron versus Kobe versus Kareem, I guess, versus, I guess what, the broad, general conversation would be Bill Russell, but I never seen Bill Russell say, that\\'s what I wouldn\\'t even talk about. - Well, you just keep skipping over, you don\\'t think it would be LeBron versus Magic? - Nah, I don\\'t think it would be LeBron versus Magic. - Why? - If you had to argue-- - Is it the bait now, LeBron versus Magic? Magic don\\'t come up in no conversations, yeah? - Because I just said, because Jordan is there, so that\\'s what I\\'m trying to say, like meaning, if there was no Jordan and you had to debate LeBron, can you say handstand-- - It\\'s LeBron versus Kareem, it\\'s probably-- - Can you say, wait, wait, wait, can you say hand down definitively, LeBron is better than Magic? - LeBron is better than, yes, I\\'m gonna say that, yes, absolutely. - Why? What makes him better than Magic? - Everything\\'s-- - What\\'s everything? - What doesn\\'t he do better than Magic? Why the artist? - What does he do better than Magic? Is this everything? - Did he choose better than Magic? - I don\\'t know about that. - He rebounds better than Magic? - Nope, he does not, actually he doesn\\'t. See, you gotta look, you gotta know your history, but he definitely doesn\\'t revound better than Magic. You gotta remember Magic was officially a point guard. Like, so when you play point guard, you start your game and at the top of the key, you don\\'t end up in rebound position. - So what does that mean? - What does that mean? - So you have more access to more rebounds if you\\'re closer to the basket, then you have access to rebounds. If you are far away from the basket, meaning anybody who expects to have courage to average 10 rebounds, he has to chase his rebounds from, like if you\\'re playing 21 and you shoot the shot, it\\'s harder for you to get the rebound and the guy that\\'s hanging around the basket, right? But what\\'s Magic? If you look at Magic\\'s rebound average, not too much different? - All right, so I\\'m looking at staff right now. So season MVPs, LeBron has four Magic got three. Finals MVP, they both got three, all NBA first team, 12 versus nine. - What\\'s 12? - LeBron. - Wait, how many seasons did Magic play though? - Nah, so the Broncos, so listen, so Magic has nine out of 12, LeBron got 12 out of 12, I\\'ve been 60 this season now over the year, 12, 12 out of 16, 12 out of 17. So-- - 12 out of 17, that\\'s it? - So nine out of 12, let me finish. So all NBA first team though, all NBA teams period. So LeBron has 15 out of 17 years, Magic has 10 out of 12 years. Only because the first team, LeBron has five, Magic has zero. All defense teams, LeBron has six, Magic has zero. Scoring leaders, LeBron has one, Magic Johnson has zero, Sizz leaders, LeBron has zero, Magic has four, still leaders. LeBron has zero, Magic has two, rookie of the year. LeBron has one, Magic has zero. Points for game, 27 versus 19. Rebound for green, they both, LeBron has 7.4, Magic has 7.2. Sizz, LeBron has seven, Magic has 11. - What, 11? (laughs) That\\'d be 11, you mean that he averaged 19, wait, what is that? - Yeah, it was 19 and 11. - Do you average 19 at 11 and seven? - Yep, 19 at 11, so yep. - Listen, you forgot I like you\\'re a good lawyer brother \\'cause you just named all the stats without the number one stat that most people named first. - What\\'s that? - What do you think, what\\'s the- - Hello. - What\\'d you say you would drop, what\\'d you say? What\\'s the most important stat? What\\'s the stat most people go to first? - With the rings? - Oh, there we go. - Magic wasn\\'t even, Magic got five rings. He wasn\\'t even, he wasn\\'t in the best player in the team or no five years, yeah. - He wasn\\'t, that\\'s what you\\'re going with? - Karim was, Karim was, Karim was- - No, he wasn\\'t brother, no. Hold on, hold on. So the final limit, he\\'s still, listen. - Even in the finals MVP, right? So he has three, he played in five finals, yeah. - Who, does Equidala have a finals MVP? - Well, now I\\'m saying everything, everything- - I\\'m just asking you a question. - No, no, no, no, no, no. We know he has a ring, but that doesn\\'t, that doesn\\'t disprove what I\\'m saying to you. I\\'m saying, but I\\'m saying Magic wasn\\'t the number one player on his team or the same degree. - So in the finals, right? - All right, let\\'s go to his rookie here, right? His rookie here, let\\'s just say, \\'cause that\\'s when Karim was at his peak, right? Right? Yeah. Let\\'s say Magic\\'s first title, right? Magic\\'s first title in the finals, right? Since Karim was the nicest point, pull up the game, clincher, you have the internet, I don\\'t have the internet. The finals, so you can see game seven or game six, but every game they clincher the finals, right? Pull up Magic\\'s and Karim\\'s stats for me real quick, brother. Since Magic wasn\\'t that, like meaning, like you should see who they leaned on based off of, you know- - Now, what I\\'m saying to you, now- - No, no, no, I\\'m just saying, do me that one quick, three- - Hold on, hold on, \\'cause that\\'s really too much. We\\'re gonna be at it. - No, it\\'s not. - Oh, man, this- - Magic was the point guard. Wait, Magic was a point guard that had to play center in the finals with no Karim. What I\\'m saying is LeBron is not- - I can\\'t hear you. I can\\'t hear you. You went on, what\\'s the name? You muted yourself. - My bad. - Yeah, yeah, what you were saying, come on, man, you gotta get your tech up. You gotta get your tech up, yeah. - Magic, I mean, LeBron is better than Magic, right? - You gotta talk it to the phone, I can\\'t hear you. - Like if you wanna go just- - If you really wanna argue, you can say that LeBron is better than Magic, right? But Magic and Bird both say that Jordan is so much better than him. Like, so LeBron, when you compare him to Magic or compare him to Bird, there\\'s an argument. But Jordan, Magic and Bird both say themselves, like, oh, Mike was on a totally different level. So if he- You get what I\\'m saying? Like, these are all time greats saying, no, this dude was much, much greater than me, right? Meaning, who\\'s LeBron\\'s peers? Like, is LeBron much, much greater than his peers? Do you think? - I think what I\\'m saying, but this is what I\\'m telling you, this is where I goes back to my point. I said, I don\\'t, that\\'s why I don\\'t do it all the time. They gotta be by errors. \\'Cause Wilk Chamberlain was killing everybody, you know what I\\'m saying? - But that makes him nice, but is LeBron killing everybody now? - Well, LeBron is not killing everybody, \\'cause the game is much more dynamic, the game is much more open, the game is more, so LeBron has way more competition than Wilk Chamberlain ever had. - Listen, I feel level. - Listen, there\\'s more. - They were giving the really bad black people in a league where Wilk King was playing like that. - You keep saying Wilk, you\\'re not saying, all right. So you think teams today are better than teams there that were in the 90s? - Absolutely, yes. - No. - So you\\'re saying that the media and player today is just on the same level as the media and player in the 90s? - You see? - That\\'s nothing to do with teams. - I don\\'t know. - I\\'m asking, \\'cause it does do with teams because that\\'s how we-- - I don\\'t really know. - Team teams are comprised of individuals. I mean, what does happen with team? - Put it like this. Teams in the 90s, right? Who are full of four-year college players who graduated, right? There were no expansion teams. The league was deeper, meaning you didn\\'t have, like in the NBA now, you have two really good guys on the team and then people, right? Like you didn\\'t have teams like the Pistons where they had Joe Dumas, Josey Thomas, Mark Aquia. You get what I\\'m saying? Like Dennis Rodman, Billy. - When I\\'m saying to you with that, the overall pool of talent in the NBA is better than the overall pool of talent in the NBA in 1990. Yes or no, do you agree with that? - No. - Okay. - Not even close. Listen, when you say pool of talent, like if you talk about a combine, if you look at the teams that didn\\'t make the, like the teams that didn\\'t make the finals, when you go down there, Ross, you start to think, how did they have all these people on one team? How did this team not win it? Like in the NBA now, teams are, there are a few teams super duper stacked. Then outside of that, it\\'s like, yeah. - NBA, that\\'s a mental about them. NBA has always been top heavy. Right? Well, before Jordan, before like 1990, most of the championships was resided with the Lakers and the Celtics. - Yeah, because they were the two best teams, what meaning? - That\\'s what I\\'m saying, but they was top heavy. Like, so the NBA has always been top heavy. Like this whole, this year was the, the years that we\\'ve been alive, that has actually ever been like three or four teams that people like can maybe win it all. When have you ever seen that? And I like to. - Oh, it used to be like that all the time. Like put it in. - Wait, wait, yeah, wait, yeah. Give me the year, yeah. - I don\\'t know. So look, before the Warriors. - No, I don\\'t know. Yeah. All right. - Give me the year. - What year? - What year? - When did the Warriors win their first title? - Five years ago. - Okay. - That year. - So that year was four teams in the NBA that you, you talk about winning title? - Absolutely. - Okay. - Right? Who were the four teams? Who did they beat in their first title one? - They beat the cast. - Okay. So was OKC nice then? - That year. OKC, now I think they beat a, OKC was nice two years before that. So they didn\\'t have Durant and Russell and, they didn\\'t have Durant and Russell and? - But they was already having issues. So I think that one of the years he got hurt, I don\\'t know what year that was. - Point it. San Antonio was still nice. - San Antonio was nice. It was San Antonio. So put it like this. There hasn\\'t been NBA team. I don\\'t think there\\'s been an NBA team that has won the championship that was less than the fourth seed or something like that. - \\'Cause when the Warriors won their first title, right? I don\\'t even think they were the number one seed. - Donna Warrie is probably the number one seed. What I\\'m saying to you is, in the history of the NBA that hasn\\'t been, I don\\'t know if there\\'s been a team that\\'s been below ranked number four in the division, that has won the championship. You frozen, you do that? - Yeah, I\\'m here brother. - I\\'m looking, I had to pull it up real quick to. - All right, well we got talk about the Bulls, man. I know you don\\'t got that much time. We got talk about the thing. And then what you take. - Oh wait, hold on one second. That\\'s when the Clippers had CP3, Blake Griffin. That\\'s when, yeah, anyway. All right, go ahead. Let\\'s talk about the Bulls. (beep) - So you read text winter books, right? - No, I didn\\'t read text winter books. I read the Michael Jordan documentary. So I know about text winter. - Oh, that\\'s it. - You think you read his book? - No, I\\'m not that. - I got too much, I got free time, but not that much. - To read a text winter book? - I love you saying you read that in the last, um. - No, I said I read the Michael Jordan documentary in it. - It goes in, not documentary. - Biography. - Biography and it goes into the text. - You\\'re in a room? - You\\'re in a room? - No, I have it in double check, but it\\'s not the one by saying, it\\'s not that one. - Okay. - It\\'s another one. It\\'s like 450 pages, man. The thing is, it goes with text winter played a big part and, um, you know, Phil Jackson\\'s philosophy. And then I read a lot about, you know, I did a lot of little, I was intrigued by it. So I read a little more about it, you know, the triangle. - Got you, got you. So seeing the episode that you saw, what was something that you would take and apply to your life or your business? - I told you, I\\'m John. Like basically skill rules off, right? Like when you\\'re skillful enough with anything, you can overcome a lot, meaning, right? So let\\'s say you have that, I don\\'t know whatever business someone\\'s in, but instead of throwing people in there, right away, just give them as much training as possible because when you\\'re skilled, you can overcome a lot of that natural ability. - So skill and hard work, man. You must, you say, scale along with hard work. I mean, what is hard work? Like, I think hard work to obtain the skill, I\\'d rather you be skillful than hardworking. - We\\'re explaining that. - Like there\\'s people who work hard, like the good old fashioned Johnny comes every day and he tries his best. Give me a guy who has, what would you rather have, actually? I\\'ll ask you, a guy with a high level of skill, an average work ethic, or a guy with average level of skill, but high work ethic. - I will take the second and because, the reason I\\'m here is \\'cause I think, I think a person with high work ethic, if you give them the proper things that they need to learn, they\\'re not getting on a learning. - They may or may not, but they may not have that, I\\'m saying skill, right? Like me now, like give me a business. Let\\'s say this, just give me any type of business. - Well, let me rewind because I think, I think I might be confusing, skill with talent. - Right. - Yeah, \\'cause with your analysis. So like you tell me somebody that\\'s, \\'cause I mean, I don\\'t know, there\\'s only so much talent, quote unquote, that you can teach, you know what I\\'m saying? Like, so for example, like no matter what you were gonna do with John Stockton, just to go back to John Stockton, he wasn\\'t gonna be Michael Jordan, \\'cause he just didn\\'t have the talent to be Michael Jordan. You know what I\\'m saying? - Right, but his skill level, meaning he did everything that you were supposed to do. - Which it probably, if you watch him and really break down his game, he probably did everything textbook, how you\\'re supposed to do it to the tee, right? Like the way that he even got open on shots, like he didn\\'t try to break you down on the dribble. He ran through screens, ran around, you know? And there\\'s some people who might have way more ability, but may not be willing, I\\'m not doing all that running around, I\\'ll just cross them over and get my own shot, you know? - Yeah. - And that\\'s the difference. He stopped at the key, I watched like on a fast break, he literally ran it, stopped boom, bounce pass, nothing crazy, nothing special. So if you have, I like I said, I took from that, if you have a high level of skill, on a high level of skill. - You distinguish in a skill from talent. - Talent and skill aren\\'t even close, they\\'re not the same. - Okay. - You can be talented and not be skillful, like Zab Judas talented. Can you be skillful when not talented? - I think you can be, yeah, absolutely. - Okay. - Skill is something that you learn, like skill is like man hours, you know? Like you put man hours into developing this skill, right? Talent means that if you do it at the same time as someone else, you\\'re probably gonna be way better. But if you don\\'t cultivate that talent, that guy who like right now, if me, you and someone else decided to go skiing, one of us is gonna learn how to ski a lot quicker than everyone else, right? So you\\'re more talented than me. If you can pick up skiing in 30 minutes and it took me two hours to figure it out, you\\'re more talented, right? But if I go every day for three hours a day and you only go once a month, I\\'m gonna be more skilled at it. Even though if all things be an equal, we put in the same amount of work you\\'d beat me. - Gotcha. - You know what I\\'m saying? So I developed the skill over, if you ask me, that\\'s my opinion. So I think skill, right? Like a lot of times, if once you develop the certain skills, like bad ability, then you don\\'t have to worry about what attributes you already have or don\\'t have. You know, like people will say, oh, I\\'m not good at sales. I\\'m not good with people. I\\'m not a people person. Okay, so just learn if they say this, you say that. If they say this, you say that. And guess what? You don\\'t have to rely on natural ability \\'cause you already have, you know, you have to skill. - Yeah, the skill, so you got the blueprint. Yeah, I think-- - You have the blueprint, yeah. So yeah, I think what, the major thing I took, I think we echoed this with the last, the last podcast that we did. I think the thing that stood out to me the most about the whole 10 episode is like how important the team is, y\\'all. Like, so for example, so for example, like you read the biography, so they didn\\'t really dig deep with text in the documentary like that. I think he only got like maybe 20 minutes shine in the whole joint career, if that, you know what I\\'m saying? And like, but without text, without the triangle offense, without feel, without Jerry Kraus, without Jordan, without Pippin, you know what I\\'m saying? Like, it just, you know, if you could have all, you know, the skill and talent in the world, but like in a team sport, which in the team, like life is a team sport, not to be cliche. Like, without the proper team, you know, is not going to fall in a face like that. - But you know what? Let\\'s look it on the other end, right? What if Jordan won or not Jordan? Sometimes your team can win in spite of those things, right? So who\\'s to say that Jerry Kraus was an asset? We\\'re just saying it because all that is wrong, right? - Nah, Bob, you can make the same argument of both ways though, \\'cause we would never know, right? \\'Cause all those things was in place. - You would never know, but for example, right? - Like the reason I\\'m saying a team, \\'cause Jordan wasn\\'t feeling none of Jerry Kraus\\'s decision in real time. - No, he wasn\\'t, but Jordan didn\\'t muscle him out and say, \"You know what? \"I need Jerry Kraus out of here,\" right? Like, like-- - I don\\'t even know, I don\\'t even know if he had that. I don\\'t even know if he had that. - Of course he did. - No, not before you won, not before you became a winner. I don\\'t know if he had that before you won. - Once he wins one title, first of all, he\\'s filling up the stadium every night. He\\'s much more-- - Nah, he won the title after Texan and Phil, which wasn\\'t his thing. You know what I\\'m saying? - No, what I\\'m saying is, there\\'s people who have power, right, like for example, Carmelo. - Right? - Carmelo told the Knicks, like, trade all these players for me so I can come from Denver to New York now, right? He could have easily said, \"You know what, guys? \"I\\'m coming anyway, keep these players \"because I won a strong team. \"I\\'m just gonna sign what you are as a free agent,\" right? That little decision might be the difference between Carmelo having no titles and Carmelo having. He exerted power to get it the way that he needed to mean it. A lot of times these players have power, sometimes they exert it and sometimes they may not like the decision, but they don\\'t always exert the power. You know what I mean? When you exert that power, I\\'m not saying that Mike could have got him out from day one, but after he won one or two titles, he pretty much was calling the shots. He could have had anybody there if he wanted. He could have had Phil out of there. He could have had anything. He could have did anything the way that he wanted. Nah, I don\\'t think so because they didn\\'t really, they didn\\'t, but he wasn\\'t feeling cool, co-teered it. They were saying that\\'s Jerry\\'s boy. He can\\'t stop cool, co-cones to sign it. You know what I\\'m saying? No, but you gotta remember, I keep trying to bring it up. That\\'s why I don\\'t understand why people, you have to give more credibility to the guy who wins a title, staying with one team, to a guy who wins titles with multiple teams. It\\'s no comparison. Meaning it\\'s significantly harder. That\\'s why to win titles is not what one team. I mean, that\\'s is available, but. No, no, no, what I\\'m saying is, what happens is you have to take whatever talent comes in. Whether you like it or not, there\\'s not a lot of avenues for you to bring in talent because you don\\'t have high draft picks. You don\\'t have cap space. So, cool coaches of the world, we don\\'t like them, but who else are we gonna bring in, right? Nah, what I\\'m saying, this is what I\\'m saying to you. This is what I\\'m saying. You would never know \\'cause we weren\\'t in it. Like, what I\\'m saying to you is that, I don\\'t know if Mike had that power to get Jerry, \\'cause Jerry about it there. See, and I think \\'cause Jerry, like this is another thing I have a problem with the issue with, but this goes back to, we suppose we still in the lessons. But Jerry, I think Jerry took a lot of the heat as the villain \\'cause it\\'s Michael Jordan\\'s edit, his version, and the owner came off like, like Jerry\\'s not making no decision after the owner does a cosop. You know what I\\'m saying? Mm-hmm. So like the owner, Jerry was on, what they said, he put your iron fist in the velvet glove or something like that. One of the sayings is? The iron fist? Yeah, so Jerry is the guy that\\'s taking all the bullets for the owner. Like, there\\'s no reason that there\\'s nothing that was revealed in that documentary that led me to believe that the owner just was 100% hands off that Jerry did what he wanted to do. I don\\'t know. You know what lets you believe that? The fact that he let the team break up, that\\'s all you need. Like if the owner was really hands on, he was so jokey, you gotta go. I\\'m keeping these guys, we do a one more run. He like, (mumbles) So did you sort of last part, like the last 15 minutes or whatever, when Phil was like, they came to him. And the owner was like, \"Yo, Phil, we wanna bring you back.\" Phil was like, \"Nah, I\\'m good.\" You didn\\'t see the ending. But what I\\'m trying to say is, if the owner really was hands off, right? I mean, hands on. Jerry, I mean, I think Jerry was able to run that team in the ground for years after, like years and years after, you know, like meaning, like the owner seems to me is someone where he kind of puts you in. The owner to me doesn\\'t seem like a basketball guy. Like he was a guy, I think the owner owned the White Sox too, right? - Well, he still does, owner, yeah. - Yeah, so you\\'re not a basketball guy and a baseball guy. Like he\\'s a money guy, like he makes money, he puts people in place, like run my business, I\\'ll let you rock, you know? Like that\\'s what if you ask me, I don\\'t know, I wasn\\'t around. - Yeah, I was, but allegedly Jerry, Jerry Krause, his biography of memoir is coming out, like his wife, Lisa\\'s statement saying, like, you know, he\\'s gonna let, she\\'s gonna let Jerry Krause have his final seat through his memoir. But I guess it\\'s been in the making for a minute and they\\'ve been in it. - How can you have a memoir on the making? - Nah, I think it is, nah. (laughing) - It\\'s like, it\\'s kind of, I think it\\'s been held up with editors and publishers for a minute. - \\'Cause nobody wants to read, who, are you gonna read that? You wanna read that? - Nah, I probably won\\'t read it, but. - You did, like they can put that out already. What are you holding up for? No need for editing, put that out tonight. No one\\'s reading no Jerry Krause, member. I mean, listen. - Nah, I\\'m not saying that saying I\\'m talking \\'cause we gotta go. So, now I was saying, team is important, it\\'s essential. I think, I think your only is good as your team. That\\'s me personally, but you push back a little bit. - Yeah, because I think you can bend the team to, like real leaders bend the team to their well. Like you can\\'t only determine who\\'s on your team, but you can determine how your team performs, right? So, in some cases, you have a chance to pick your team, right? In other cases, your team\\'s your team. - Yeah, yeah, go back, go back. - So you can get more performance out of your team based on how you work with them, meaning, do you feel that Jordan got all the value he could have gotten out of those players, or do you think there was value left on the table? - I don\\'t know, because it\\'s Jordan\\'s cut. So, and Jordan-- - No, just saying, face off the guy, like meaning, like there\\'s not a lot of history of people leaving the bulls and being, like for example, Scotty, when he went, wherever he went the next year to, like Scotty was, he was pretty much after a few years without Jordan, he was pretty much not, you know, he wasn\\'t the man like that. - Scotty was hurt, though, but Scotty that year, Jordan went the first of your time and Scotty boiled out the year, crazy. - He did? - Yes, he did. - Okay. - Scotty boiled out crazy that year, the year that Jordan left the first year, not the second of your time and the first of your time. - You\\'re all, you\\'re talking about the year when you decide not to go back in the game to take that shot. - Yeah, absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. And that\\'s the thing, like sometimes, look, I agree, I think the team is important, but also, you know, sometimes you can\\'t help with team you have, you gotta just make the team that you have work, you know? - Yeah. - You gotta get to the reason why. - I\\'m not even saying it. - So, all right, so, \\'cause no matter what, for me, we talk about success, but the opposite of successes, well, majority people was in the middle between they being successful, like, it\\'s \\'cause it\\'s only gonna be one NBA champion, right? Every year, you know what I mean? So, I don\\'t think that\\'s necessarily, like that\\'s the pinnacle of success, but there are successful teams that don\\'t win, like, San Antonio probably is the most successful franchise out there the last 20 years, you know what I\\'m saying? All right, they consistently competed for championships, but the reason I\\'m saying team is because they\\'re also, like, until, like, recently, the Clippers was, like, the worst team for a reason, you know what I\\'m saying? They didn\\'t have good leadership. They were, they were, you know what I\\'m saying, that the owner wasn\\'t interested in building the team, or the team that they did have, they were, the chemistry was all, you know what I mean? That\\'s the one thing I think, what\\'s another one? \\'Cause we got, let\\'s get this, let\\'s get this rapping up so we can do it again next week. What\\'s another one? What\\'s number two you took from it? I mean, I can\\'t think of anything right now. You got a second one? I can\\'t think of it. - I think emotional intelligence, like the EQ, I think that\\'s highly underrated, and I society, like, everybody talks about IQ, but nobody really talks about EQ like that. Like, just being emotionally, have that emotional intelligence to know, like what motivates people, how you motivate people. \\'Cause that\\'s all the skill, like Phil Jackson seems like he was the master at that. At least with that. - For sure, like he pushed, but like, there\\'s a reason, right? Like, we need it. Yeah, he did coach Jordan, yeah, he did coach Colby. But he didn\\'t come into title-winning teams, like he didn\\'t come in and they won their first title, and then he had to defend it. Like, the narrative is different if he\\'s just helping these teams defend titles. He had to make these teams turn into winning teams by finding individual buttons to push that he knows. Like, the button he had to push for Jordan was a different button than for Pippin. Like, the fact that he didn\\'t chew Pippin out, and he liked the team chew him out. - He\\'s a genius, that\\'s that emotional. - Yeah, like he knew at that point, like, you know what? No need for me to drive at home. Everyone knows what he did is wrong. I\\'ll let them handle it, you know? Some coaches wouldn\\'t have that ability to do that. Some coaches would go, no, you gotta leave my team right now. No, you let the other, you know, so you\\'re right. The emotional intelligence, yeah, Phil Jackson, I think, is Phil Jackson probably should have the next, you know, deep, deep dive, you know? \\'Cause I think he- - His book, he released a book, I didn\\'t read it, but he released a book. Maybe he- - And he\\'s the definition of a winner, right? Meaning he\\'s the one that\\'s a player, he\\'s one as a coach, and one organization left, and one at another organization, right? - He\\'s the ultimate winner. Like, the few ultimate winners out there, and there ain\\'t a lot of them, but the few ultimate winners. - There\\'s a few ultimate winners, and he\\'s one. Like right now, you ask people who\\'s the best coach, people are gonna say, pop a bitch, you know? Not realizing that, you know, you got a guy who bounced from team to team, played, and different. Again, even to have the ability to share the spotlight with the triangle, right? He didn\\'t have to run the triangle. - He didn\\'t have to run the triangle at all. - No. So, no, for sure. You\\'re right though, you know, the emotional intelligence has never really highlighted, so I agree. - Yeah, and what he\\'s doing, Rob, and just even when he doing Rob, I\\'m like, \"Yo, we know Rob ain\\'t gotta go beat Rob, \"you know what I\\'m saying?\" \\'Cause a lot of people are like, \"Yo, fuck that, you gotta come back to practice.\" You know what I\\'m saying? Like, \"Nah, we gonna let him do what he gotta do, \"Blow a steam.\" Like, this is that emotional telling is that- - Right, again, that comes from what I\\'m not gonna keep on from, that also comes from what I was saying. Like, when you keep winning, you don\\'t have a lot of avenues for talent. So, you can\\'t just cut Rodman and go, \"Rodman, you gotta go.\" You\\'ve been partying in the Vegas. \\'Cause there\\'s no other avenues. Like, you don\\'t have cap room. You pay in Jordan 30 million a year. You don\\'t have draft hits. You always pick and last every year \\'cause you always win the title every year. And you gotta deal with his shenanigans a little bit. \\'Cause you know that if you get rid of him, the next guy you got is, you know? - Yeah, yeah. So, yeah. - So, yeah. Yeah, it was three times the three. So, your first one was what? - Skill. - Skill versus talent. So you\\'re gonna take- - No, yeah, it\\'s skill. - Skill, oh, yeah. - Skill over. - Skill. - Skill. - Skill over. Yeah, natural ability. - Skill over natural ability. So, my second, my, my, my, number two was a, well, I guess my one, but every number two on the list would be team. I think team over individuals. And then my number three would be EQ. EQ over IQ in a lot of ways. \\'Cause you can be the smartest person on the planet, but if you don\\'t know how to convey the messages and deal with people and get people on your team, I think it\\'s gonna show in your organization. - Right, for sure. Like meaning, you know, and Phil let Mike be Mike up to a certain point and then would rail him back. Like, all right, you don\\'t have to do too much, you know? - You don\\'t do too much, yeah. - Right. - I think that\\'s a good thing that the lead to listeners with him to next week. - Sounds good, brother. - Yeah, then- - All right, brother. - All right, man, be good, man. Thanks again a lot. - All right, please, please, please. (beeping) (dramatic music) - How\\'s everything going, yeah? - I\\'m good, man. I see you got the fit. You got a collection of fitters, bro. - Now these are not fitters. These are dad hats, don\\'t you? I don\\'t know where fit is going. - Oh, no, you got, oh, not anything. Oh. Yeah, that\\'s the strap, not even the snacks. The strap. - You should have a strap, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don\\'t even do straps now, brother.

      "{'transcript': ' [Music] Welcome to \"Brazing Education\" with Educator Barnes. A podcast was a focus on speaking your truth, being transparent to others, and having no shame about it. Because we can\\'t move forward until the truth is known. [Music] Welcome back to \"Brazing Education.\" This episode is called \"Why Black Educators Feel Emotionally Unsafe at School.\" First, I want to preface this with, this may not be the case for every single black educator, but too many of us have these experiences, so I think this is a good topic to talk about. I\\'m going to do something that I haven\\'t done on my podcast before. I\\'m going to read something I wrote for NDK-12, if you don\\'t already know, I\\'m a writer for that publication and I\\'m the editor-in-chief. And I think this is an important place to start. And I\\'m going to start there. This piece is called \"Race and Equity Talks Have Magnified How Emotionally Unsafe I Feel at My School.\" I don\\'t feel emotionally safe at my current school. Typically, I avoid writing about my current job. I am a middle school academic dean who supervises and evaluates non-educators. I never want any personized to revise to believe I\\'m impashing them online. I am in a position of power and I must use it wisely. Although the majority of my career, I have worked for traditional public schools. I am currently employed by a charter network. The executive director of the charter network, the principal, and other staff members have shared with others and me directly how much of an asset I am to the school. My principal even wrote this in my interview performance review. Chantay always maintains a positive attitude and creates a productive work environment around her. She handles stressful situations with great confidence. She is not afraid of difficulties. She is calm and composed under high pressure. She has a great work ethic. She is detail-oriented and meets deadlines. I appreciate how she is highly dependable and whenever she promises to accomplish a task, she does it regardless of the circumstances. I enjoy working alongside Chantay and I\\'m looking forward to another year. When I read these words, I was equally filled with joy and sadness. I was happy because I worked hard to be the best at every school where I am employed. I believe students deserve a high-level excellence from the administrators and teachers who serve them. I was sad because stressful situations and difficulties include bullying, harassment, racism, and microaggressions. Let me be direct about the bullying and harassment. A colleague admitted doing that to me, so that\\'s not my words. Despite it all, I have chosen to remain calm. Despite it all, I have pushed through and completed tasks. My internal voice said, \"Chantay, you are here to serve the kids.\" It\\'s hard to work with people when you don\\'t trust them or feel emotionally safe around them. I assert that too many black people have learned to play the game of enduring emotionally unsafe environments peacefully so they won\\'t be seen as a threat or have consequences that show up in a performance review. It\\'s important to me to have an excellent performance review and to be seen in a good light by my principal. I did not want to be the source of complaints and I wanted to show that I could handle it all, but I am emotionally exhausted. Now, George Floyd\\'s murder has forced Americans into conversations about racism against black people. First, came the statements of solidarity with the black community. Now, organizations are having race and equity talks. The executive director of my charter organization is having a listening tour of this entire week. I attended the first session earlier in the week. The staff members who attended were black and Latino. No white staff members attended. This was an opportunity to share our thoughts. I was angry the entire time. I did not feel safe the entire time. I only shared a fraction of what I wanted to say. The fraction I shared prompted an apology email from the executive director to me and an invitation to help with the work to make the school a better place. However, I don\\'t know if I have it in me to help. A few points that I shared I have shared before this school year and nothing changed. Sharing all the negative situations that have happened to me this school year, put me in a situation to retraumatize myself and relive it. Listening to other people\\'s share was emotionally taxing. Even though I already knew some of their stories. I have not slept well since participating in a listening tour. And this was only the listening tour. I\\'m taking a risk today writing about how I currently feel knowing that could result in some negative ramifications. However, I need school leaders to know this process is traumatizing for black staff members. We are being asked to share these experiences that most of us have choked down just so we can function at work. It is how we survive. Bernie\\'s King, Dr. King\\'s daughter recently tweeted, \"Even this statement, \\'less invite more black people to the table implies ownership of the table and control of who is invited. Racism is power.\" Her words resonated with me. I\\'m humbled by the fact that I have been invited to the table many times. Too often I learn I have no power. The table is nothing more than the opportunity to check a box to claim issues or be in address. If I\\'m going to potentially put myself through trauma, stress and backlash, because we all know race and equity work comes with backlash, I want to at least have the power to make a change. Beneath my calmness, a fire is raging. I want to believe I\\'ll keep a lid on it and stay professional. The current climate of America is a pressure cooker. And writer J. Baldwin said, \"To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be enraged almost all the time.\" Some people fear black people, but angry black people are the most feared. We should be angry. We deserve to be angry. Right now my rage wants to knock over the table, light it on fire, enjoy watching it burn and gather some black people and build our own table. Where can black people be safe? We can\\'t be safe at home, in public or at work. We definitely are not safe at someone else\\'s table. School leaders engaging in race and equity work need to know it will be hard. The ugliest parts of the organization will be brought to light. The school leader will either be guilty of participating in the harm or allowing it to thrive. The ways the school operates will need to change. People will need to be fired or coached out. Curricula will need to be decolonized and re-envisioned. Students will need to be included. They have stories too. If school leaders can\\'t handle all of this or are not ready to do this, their race and equity work will truly not take place. I am no longer interested in being at any table where I will be triggered for the sake of a show or checking a box. Right now, I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do. I am conflicted. Black staff members are conflicted. If our Black lives really mattered at our school, why are leaders only listening to us now? Why did it take George Floyd\\'s death and worldwide protests for school leaders to care now about the oppression we have faced and our students have faced? We are being asked to trust that the situation will change. Historically speaking, we have records that show time and time again, nothing changes and the grips of white supremacy and the status quo reign supreme. That\\'s what I wrote. When I truly say I took a risk, I took a risk. Typically, if you follow what I write or you listen to what I say, you know that sometimes I don\\'t get into the specifics and honestly that\\'s for self-preservation. Because I like being an educator. I like serving students and their family and I don\\'t want to jeopardize that opportunity. But on the other hand, I know we don\\'t start addressing these serious issues in society, in our community, in our school. We will be stuck with the status quo. We\\'ll just buckle and say, \"Well, white supremacy is the law of the land and that\\'s how it is.\" And the fight, the anger, the rage, the fire that\\'s burning with Emmy just can\\'t accept like, \"This is how it\\'s going to be.\" Like, I don\\'t want to accept that this is how it\\'s going to be for my children and for my grandchildren. And if I want to be honest right now, my twin sons are nine. They are nine years old and they have already faced racism. They\\'ve already been discriminated against. They\\'ve already been mistreated at school. They\\'ve already been judged for being nothing more than a boy who has black skin. And if that\\'s the plight of my children, how can I operate in the school where I know that\\'s the plight of other children? How can I go and collect my check and do nothing or say nothing? And that\\'s the crossroads you\\'re stuck between when you\\'re a black educator. You\\'re stuck between preserving yourself or looking out for the kids. And you say to yourself, \"I took this oath when I decided to become an educator, when I decided to get this job, I\\'m doing it because I love children. I want them to learn.\" And if I\\'m silent, if I\\'m silent, then I\\'m saying that\\'s okay because silence is violence. Silence is being complicit. Silence is saying, \"You know, I\\'m okay with it.\" But at the same time, I\\'m tired. I\\'m tired. I\\'m exhausted. I\\'m mentally worn out. I don\\'t want to go through and rehash every bad thing that\\'s ever happened to it. So you can hear and then you can acknowledge it. So you can apologize for me to me and then nothing changes. Like, what\\'s the point? I mean, are you going to pay my therapy bill? Because real talk, a lot of us need to be a therapy right now. And I\\'ve been really transparent about the fact that I\\'ve been in therapy before. But all these events that have been happening, it makes me feel like I\\'m going to be right back in there. And there\\'s nothing wrong with seeing the therapist. And that\\'s the stigma in the black community. So our communities are already stigmatized. And honestly, you know, for a lot of us, we don\\'t want to talk to a white person about this stuff. We don\\'t feel safe. And so you won\\'t have these conversations. But even in a conversation, we don\\'t feel safe. Because we know about this whole crowd in the bucket syndrome. We know that some black people, for the sake of preserving themselves, will throw you under the damn bus. So the bank is staying on top. So if I get too honest, somebody who looks like me may stab me in the back. If I get too honest, then I got the other people. And that person could be white. That person could be Latino. And I\\'ve shared across my social media, and I appreciate these people. I share the piece about Asians and how they need to combat anti-black racism. I share the piece about Latinos and how they need to combat anti-black racism. So a lot of times when we have these conversations, we get caught up in the white black thing. But when you\\'re black, you have felt the boot on your neck from people who don\\'t look like you. And not just white folks. And I follow a native Twitter or a Indigenous Twitter. And even as someone, those conversations. And I just sit back and listen, because I\\'m here to learn from my Indigenous brothers and sisters. And even within that community, I hear black, Indigenous people talk about how they\\'ve been oppressed within their own Indigenous community. So it doesn\\'t really matter where we are or who we\\'re with. Even another group of people of color could come against us. And to me, that\\'s so tragic. Because this is not the, we talk a lot when I talk to different people, people who are of color, but they\\'re not black. We talk about this is not the oppression Olympics. If you don\\'t know what that is, that\\'s when, let\\'s say I\\'m black. And I talk about the things bad that\\'s happened to me. And then you\\'re not black, what\\'s to say your Indigenous or your Latino. And then you said, but what about what\\'s happening to me? It\\'s not a competition. But if we know all of us are facing some type of racism and discrimination, we don\\'t need a discriminated against other groups of color. That don\\'t make any sense. And so my experience has not just been discrimination and racism from white people. It\\'s been from other groups of people of color. And so you feel, and then you have those people, they\\'re black who feel like the only way I can be okay is to throw another black person on the bus. And so now you feel like I think I mostly can trust the black folks, but you know, some of y\\'all may be a little shady and be a crab in the bucket trying to pull me down. I don\\'t know about the white people because like time and time again, I got experience as a experience as a experience as a experience of bad things happening. And if you don\\'t have the experience, you have people in your family has the experience. I mean, I think about the time when I was at my father\\'s childhood house that his brother used to live in before it was sold. And my dad told me, he told me, and I can\\'t remember how old he was. So I was somewhere between the ages of 10 and 13, but he told me how white guy pulled a gun on him. Now my dad is 70. He literally has had a job since he was 10. And that\\'s just so his family could survive. With a step-show of when he was in the Marines, my dad has literally had a job since he was 10 years old. And so he was just out just doing one of his jobs. All types of stuff, washing windows, doing yard work, being a newspaper boy. Man was going to shoot him because they thought he had was somebody else and had did something. And then my dad says, and then another white person comes out and please on my behalf. And when I was listening to my dad tell me the story, he has told me so many stories, I just thought about what must it have felt like for my dad to be in the middle or you have one white person condemning you and you have another white person fighting and say, oh no, he\\'s a good Negro. Not this one. And then I thought about how I told my dad. There\\'s a popular magazine school here in Indianapolis that\\'s offered me a job three times and three times I\\'ve turned it down because I\\'ve had another offer that I\\'ve liked better. And one of the time I was talking to my dad about it and my dad said, oh, that school? Yeah, I had to be escorted into the neighborhood around that school. And I said, Dad, what do you mean? And so my dad told me about how you would do your work over there. And again, white folks would come out and be like, what you doing in this neighborhood? And harass him so he had to have a white man escort him into the neighborhood. And when I was listening to my dad say this so he could do the work, you know, to get the few coins. So his family could be okay. And when I heard my dad tell me the story, I thought about what it must feel like to have a white person vouch for you. So you can go collect a few little coins so your family could survive. And so those are my father\\'s experiences. I\\'m not talking about my grandparents or my great-grandparents. I\\'m talking about my dad who is still alive and walking this earth. And you probably say, well, Chantay, that\\'s so horrible. But see, when you\\'re a black parent, your job is to inform your kids of the experiences you\\'ve had. And I won\\'t share some of the stuff that my dad shared about his work and his job, but he shared time and time again about some experiences so I could be prepared to walk into the workplace knowing that this is probably going to happen. But I still walked in. I stopped walking in your one optimistic saying, you know what? You know, we\\'re in the 2000s because I started teaching in 2006. We\\'re in the 2000s. I know my dad said these bad things happen to him. These things won\\'t happen to me at my job. I won\\'t get discriminated at my job because we are so far advanced. Year one, I got called in from the action hire. Year one, I was told that I stole a job from a white person. I stole the job. That\\'s how my career started. And every single school year, I can tell you something that has happened that I would classify as a microaggression, racism, harassment, or bullying every single year of my 14th year career. I have a story. And anyone who knows me knows that I\\'m very introverted, believe it or not. Even this school year, we took a personality test and on my personality test, it came out that was 90% introverted. That was really shocking to know because honestly, I thought, well, come on, but 95 or something. But I\\'m not shy. When I\\'m in big, large gatherings, I don\\'t talk much. And some of you who have met me in person because it\\'s kind of weird. It\\'s like, oh, hey, you guys are for NDK 12. And I\\'m like, hey, you\\'re trying to take a selfie with me right now. This is weird because I\\'m really, really, like, I just really try to hang in this bee. And I\\'m not, you know, I try. I\\'m telling you, I try. So if I look awkward, socially awkward, I am a socially awkward person. I won\\'t cop to that. And that is okay. I own the fact that sometimes I come off as a weird quirky black woman. And I\\'m okay with that. I love myself. But that\\'s the thing. I have to love myself. I have to speak words of affirmation to myself to get through at work because I know these things could happen. I know I could be in an environment. And then on top of that, so I\\'m in this toxic, turbulent environment. And still, I have to perform. And time and time again, I have pressable. I said, I love working with Shante. I hope you come back next school year. You know, you got great dating with kids. You know, you hardly send no kids out of the classroom. Man, you coached that teacher well. Time and time again. So do you know how hard it is to do all those things when you are trying to choke down negative comments that\\'s been said to you? You\\'re trying to choke down people trying to snitch and cattle on you about nothing. I mean, the things that people have tried to literally throw me on your push for, and then I had to go, and then I had to go and explain myself. Do you know how many times I had to go explain myself because some white person at my job, and I\\'m brought up something? Oh, Shante\\'s using that third novel. Oh, Oh, Shante\\'s having the kids to this extra project. Not worrying about your low data. Not worrying about the fact that you\\'re kicking kids out of class, but you\\'re worrying about me. They\\'re like, good data. That\\'s managing my class. Well, that by all accounts to everyone else, I\\'m an asset. I\\'m a benefit to the school. And instead of those conversations being nipped in the bud, I get asked, I get brought to the carpet to explain and justify myself. Suit to appease this person that\\'s bringing us on concerns. It\\'s happened this school year. It\\'s happened at previous jobs. And I told my dad because I normally, I have to balance between venting, between my dad and my husband, because I don\\'t want to put all the burden on my husband because he has his own experiences. What was like to have his job? My husband\\'s also an administrator. He\\'s in technology. And I mean, when you\\'re a black administrator, you\\'re like, we are? And you are over white people? That is an interesting dynamic. So you really have to mind your P\\'s and your Q\\'s and your mind, your manners. Because I don\\'t know how else to say this because if you\\'re too tough, then white folks start crying. And when white people start shedding tears, I don\\'t care what you do. You look like you guilty of something because they start crying. Now let my black little self go in and start crying. Nobody\\'s going to care. If you know me, I\\'m not one of those crying folks. And nothing wrong with crying. I\\'m not saying that. I\\'m just not a person that disperses tears. It\\'s not what I do. I\\'m one of those people that kind of, I\\'m calling. I\\'m like, \"Ugh, I\\'m mad. I\\'m not a crier.\" But you have to balance this. I have to think about how much of the frustration do I dump on my husband? And how much do I dump on my dad? So this time I just had to dump on my dad and I said, \"Daddy, I\\'m sick.\" And I\\'m tired of explaining myself to people. Why do I have to keep explaining myself? I\\'m tired of it. And my dad says something to the effect of, that\\'s just how it is. They think. They can ask you anything at any time. They feel that they have the right to demand that of you. That\\'s the system. That\\'s white supremacy. When any time they can bring you to the carpet and ask you to justify your action, even if there\\'s no justification for it. But if someone else is actually doing something, actually doing harm, well, you know, you get that well you know, which is a long way for they are back to walk around the bush the long way and explain how they\\'re not going to do anything. And, you know, why don\\'t you just keep to yourself and keep doing a good job? I mean, I am so tired of being your token, good Negro. I\\'m so tired of being that. Throughout my career, I\\'ve been the only black English teacher in the department. I\\'ve been the only black English language learner or teacher for a whole district. Only black librarian for the whole district. And even at my school, my principal is biracial. She\\'s black and white. But I would consider myself the only black minisher at my school because I see my friends are biracial. And so when you\\'re in those spaces, when you\\'re the only, you know you\\'re going to come to the table with, I did that, potentially going to be different. And you know how you\\'re going to be met. And you, because you know all these things, you\\'re like, I have to be the best. I have to show black excellence because I don\\'t want anybody to think that I was only higher because of my skin color. I have to prove time and time and time again. You know you\\'re so good with the kids. Oh I like how you did this. And it\\'s just like that\\'s all I am to you. I\\'m just a token. I\\'m just a trophy. I\\'m your little black person. That you can just kick out here and say, look how great Chantay is. We\\'ve got diversity here. And look, and our diversity even gets results. That\\'s how I\\'ve been made the feel. And I\\'m tired. And I started myself a break this week. And you would think I would be relaxing, chilling, enjoying myself. I\\'ve been drained. I\\'ve been stressed. I have had sleepless nights. And on top of that, I mentor other educators. And many of them are black. Not all of them. It\\'s on top of that I\\'m listening to their stories. And I listen because as much as I need to be able to dump to someone, I know they need to be able to dump to someone. And when I hear their stories, I can relate because it\\'s like, yeah, that\\'s happened to me and that too. And then I get a little pep talk. I say, you know, just try this. And you know, we got to keep speaking up. And it\\'s like, I got to say it out loud. Not just only to convince them. I got to say it out loud again to convince myself if we just keep speaking up. We just keep advocating. If we just all band together, it all get better. And then you wonder why you hear black people say stuff like, forget this. Forget the whole system. Let\\'s just all come together. And let\\'s go away and build our own thing because there is a video clip that\\'s floating around the internet. And it\\'s James Baldwin who I quote in my piece. And he says something to the fact is taking my mother\\'s time. He\\'s taking my grandmother\\'s time. And he says, how long for your progress? And that\\'s how I feel. How long? Because the progress is so slow. I think about my great grandparents. You want to know why I live in Indiana? You want to know why? It\\'s because my great grandparents lived in Georgia. They lived in Georgia. And the clue clucks Klan burned down their house twice. Twice. On the second occasion, I\\'m not going to say what I was told they were said. They were told that they was said to them. But it essentially said if yes, they are right here, it\\'s not going to just be your house the next time. So in the middle of the night, my great grandparents gathered up their children and went north. And you know the irony of this story? They stopped in Indiana. The first child they had in Indiana was my grandmother. And why that\\'s ironic if you don\\'t know. One of the biggest hoves of the KK was right here in Good Old Indiana. And so that\\'s where my family landed. That\\'s why we\\'re here up in the north because they were escaping terror. So I was supposed to be happy that in 2020, at least the clue clucks Klan had to burn down my house. So when I hear James ball, when I hear that couple, he says, how long for your progress? I felt every single word that man was saying because if this is the progress, it\\'s that, oh, the KKK is not putting across in my yard and that burn down my house. They\\'re saying they\\'re going to burn me and my kids alive. You know, it must be great. You know, you know, you gotta take, you know, you got a good job. You were able to go to college. My grandparents couldn\\'t read. And my sons, both of my sons, are published authors. My dad said to me, my grandparents couldn\\'t read, but my grandsons are published authors. That shouldn\\'t, I mean, is that the bar for progress right now? Because I want more. I want more. And so right now as I wrap this up, I can\\'t tell you what I want to do. How I can tell you right now is I\\'m mad. I\\'m angry. I\\'m upset. And I\\'m tired of feeling like this, but I can\\'t escape it. It\\'s on Twitter. It\\'s on LinkedIn. It\\'s on Facebook. It\\'s on Instagram. It\\'s on the TV. If I call my parents, they\\'re talking about it. My friends are talking about it. The race, the conversation is right there in my face. And I can\\'t look away. I can\\'t escape. I can\\'t choose the opt out because I\\'m raising black sons. They got to be informed. It\\'s all these stuff there in West accessory street, town hall about racism. And even that made me have a conversation I didn\\'t want to have. I\\'m like, this is a assessment street. We can watch it. But they show the protests that my son says, Mom, that son does not belong in a protest. Because they explain what a protest is, why people would protest. Well, one, they show video of protests, you know, peaceful protests. And we can have a whole side conversation about why putting the word peaceful in front of our protest is problematic. So I\\'ll say that for another time. And my son says that that sign makes no sense. I said, what sign? He says, I can\\'t breathe. Why are people carrying that? Now, you know, during the will, I can explain that sign to my son unless I tell him why people are carrying that sign. But my son saw the other signs. They were saying black lives matter. Okay, that makes sense. Mommy says I\\'m important. I\\'m black. That makes sense. You know, racism must end. Okay. Yeah. But I can\\'t breathe. He\\'s like, what does that have to do with anything? So I told my sons before we even watched that, you know, some black people had died, you know, that\\'s making people have this conversation. But I didn\\'t tell them how they died. And so I was processing. What do I say to my son who\\'s asking me why the sign is there? It doesn\\'t belong. Because you know we\\'re watching Sessary Street and you know in Sessary Street, they have that segment on one of these things is not like the other. So he\\'s like, this mommy, this doesn\\'t fit. And so I started to explain. I said, well, a police officer killed a man and he suffocated to death. He cut off his ability to breathe and he suffocated. And my other son says, but the police are community helpers because you know the way they teach them with school because early elementary and social studies class, you learn about who\\'s in your community, you know, the mailman, the fireman, be a good citizen. And so even me saying this to my children, they\\'re like, mom, that doesn\\'t make sense. And so I can\\'t opt out of this conversation because I can\\'t have my sons be naive and be out of the world and think everything\\'s happy, go lucky. I can\\'t have them living in a fantasy of Louis Armstrong\\'s song. You know, I think to myself, what a wonderful world because the world isn\\'t wonderful. That\\'s all beside. So I had to explain to my nine year old sons that the people that are supposed to protect and serve us, murdered one of us, why the video camera is rolling? And I had some friends that showed their children the video and I have chosen not to show my children the video. It\\'s bad enough I have to have the conversation. I don\\'t need to traumatize them letting them watch eight minutes and forty six seconds of someone\\'s life being snuffed out. No. But I had to break apart their bubble, part of their innocence more today to explain that to them. So again, I don\\'t know what I\\'m willing to do, but if you\\'re a school leader and you\\'re listening, you got to take this seriously. And I strongly suggest that you offer some mental health services to your employees that you\\'re traumatizing through this process because we don\\'t need it. And if you\\'re not really ready for the change, then maybe you should step down and leave. Because we look at schools a lot of times, the higher up you get, the wider it gets. And a lot of the people at the top are maintaining the status quo. They\\'re allowing white supremacy to rain. And so I wish at the end of this podcast I had a sweet little message for you guys. I wish I could offer you some words of hope. So I\\'ll go back to what my grandmother used to tell me. She would say this simply, \"I wish she got up each day.\" She says, \"I thank the Lord for giving me one more day on the earth. I got a breath in my body and I got a good another chance.\" So I\\'ll leave you with that. I got a good another chance. I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen with my chance. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll get another chance because that\\'s the reality of being black in America. You don\\'t know how many more chances you\\'re going to get. You don\\'t know if you\\'ll get the diet a naturally old ripe age. You don\\'t know. But as long as I have life and as long as I wake up the next day, it\\'s an opportunity. It\\'s a possibility that something might change. And that\\'s the thing I have to hold on to today to keep me moving forward. Because if I don\\'t have that, I\\'m nothing but a ball of rage. And we already know what anger can do. It can be destructive. And I want my anger to be constructive. And the only way it can be constructive if I couple it with, there\\'s a possibility that it might get better. Thanks for listening.

      "{'transcript': ' It\\'s Friday night everybody, you know what that means. It\\'s Friday night, let\\'s have some fun. Let\\'s get together and play a ton. Hi, I\\'m Matt. And I\\'m John. And together, we\\'re... Friday night night. And again, and again! And with us today is our longtime good friend, Mr. Kevin Kwan. Welcome back, sir. Hello. Good to be back. Glad to be here. Great. Are you ready for today\\'s topics or what? Yeah. Well, Kevin, on today\\'s show, we\\'re going to discuss an old genre that\\'s making a comeback. Role in right games. We\\'re going to go over a new game that was sent to us, Rosetta, The Lost Language by Story Machine Games. We will take a little history lesson and look at some of the first rolling-right games. We\\'ll take a little look into some of those games as well. And we\\'ll talk about some games that we recently played. And we might geek out or something after. All right, guys, so since I\\'m a noob, what\\'s a rolling-right? Rolling-right games are generally games where you roll a die and write something down on a pad of paper. However, there have been some games that come out instead of die you\\'re drawing playing cards. But generally, the game includes a set of dice and a custom pad for you to write your score down. So pretty simple concept, pretty easy to follow along and play. So Rosetta was pretty nifty. I actually got to sit down and play with you, John. That was quite a fun experience. Do you want to talk a little bit about that? Yeah, so Story Machine Games reached out to me about a month ago. I\\'m asked if we\\'d be interested in reviewing their game Rosetta, the less language, and described it as a co-op language puzzle. So I thought that was pretty interesting because I didn\\'t really understand what that meant. So I\\'m just, yeah, sure, send us a game. I\\'ll play it. We\\'ll play whatever. And because of everything with COVID and all that stuff going on, our postage system is a little bit delayed. So I didn\\'t actually get the game until about almost a month later. I just got it, I think, last week or something. So in the game, Rosetta, players take on two different roles. So one person acts as an author, and that person draws two cards. So one card is an inscription. So it has almost like hieroglyphic images on it. And then you flip a location card. I think the artwork on it\\'s beautiful. It almost looks like a landscape painting where you draw inspiration as to what the inscription means. And then once you find out the meaning, you write it on one of the cards provided. And the other players will act as experts. And they\\'re trying to come up with the meaning that you made making guesses. They\\'re writing guesses on the cards. And if they\\'re on the right track, the author clues them in. So they\\'ll give them hints along the way. And if they\\'re not on the right track, they\\'ll just say, nope, they\\'ll scratch the card. They\\'ll get the guess down. So the experts have 10 guesses to guess the meaning of the inscription. So actually, we had a lot of fun. And I liked how our group did it because we played with four of us. And I really liked that two of us went super serious with the meaning. And then two of us went super silly with the meaning. You also played this game, two player. Right. With your wife. And then you played it four players with myself, you, Bill, and Novi. Right. I had the four player experience. Can you describe the two player experience? Compare it to what we did before. Yeah. I mean, the two player experience was decent. I think I had more fun playing it as the four player experience. I think more players, the better interaction. Because the author doesn\\'t-- I mean, you can talk as much as you want. There\\'s no rules against it. But I think just with how everything\\'s set up, it\\'s good to just give hints with the cards that are being drawn, rather than using your voice. It was fun interacting with everyone else when we were taking turns being experts. Then it was just being an author or an expert. Yeah. I definitely had a lot of fun being an expert. The experts were the people who tried a guess, right? Am I right? OK. Yeah. So I had a lot of fun doing that. With three people, it was very easy to throw out ideas. And I noticed, for instance, myself, I might be on one track. Like, my mind just might be on one single thing. And that\\'s all I\\'m focused on. And then someone like yourself, John, you would throw out, hey, Matt, no, you\\'re not thinking of this. And then our ideas kind of come together. I\\'m sure you\\'re thinking the same thing. And our ideas kind of come together. And that\\'s when you start solving the problem that\\'s in front of you. You\\'re trying to guess what the author wrote. Right. And in my two-player game that I played, I think my wife picked a word-- I think her word was like trailblazer or something like that. And that\\'s just-- It\\'s hard. That\\'s a hard word. It\\'s a hard word to guess. Number one. And I was kind of on the right track at one point. And then I got kind of side-lined. And I was going a completely different direction. So I mean, the goal is to come up with easy words. So they\\'re easy to guess. Yeah, so let\\'s think of that for a second. So a card has three-- it looks like hieroglyphics. And the location is a location. And you\\'re trying to use a hieroglyphics to come up with something at the location that\\'s actually not there. Right. So you look at the location card, and you\\'re not allowed to create a word of something you see on the location. You just have to be inspired by it. So it\\'s really cool. So you look at the inscription. I forget what the word that I used. Oh, mine was like cooking. I think was the-- yeah, cooking was my-- Yes, it was. Yeah. So my meaning I saw was cooking. And the location, it looked like an-- like a Native American landscape. There was like a tent. I think there\\'s some-- like almost like a campground, I guess. Maybe my inscription to kind of look like a person holding kind of like a piece of like a triangle, like a piece of bread or something. And then I think that resembled fire. Every card has three technically symbols on it. So what you did was you took that card, and you\\'re like, this looks like that to me. It looked like a person cooking. So you had to sit there, kind of turn the image into something. Because you could only put one word on the-- the author can only use one word. He can\\'t use several words. It has to be one word. Right. Yeah, so I kind of make like a meaning for each symbol that I see. So the one meaning was like person. The other one was fire. And the other one was bread, I think, or food. Pan or grill, yeah. Something like that, right? And yeah, so I\\'m like, hey, what\\'s that? Like what\\'s one word that can combine all of those? And that was my meaning. Cooking was my word. And you actually guys got it pretty quick. I think you got like three or four cards in, which is pretty cool. Well, I thought when I was the author, everyone got it really quickly. I think that was the quickest. So when I was the author, they had this battle scene. And my card kind of had like this sword looking thing on it. The two outside glyphs, one looked like a person, one didn\\'t. And I\\'m like, eh, I\\'ll just kind of-- I got battle from it right away. And I\\'m like, and so in my mind, I\\'m like person, slays, innocent person. That\\'s kind of what had in my mind. So I had a couple words, but I\\'m like, I\\'ll go with an easier one. And I think that easier one wasn\\'t the best idea because the three of you guessed it really quickly. Well, but you\\'re supposed to guess it quickly. Oh. Yeah, that\\'s the idea. So I\\'m good. Yeah, so the faster-- think about each card as a point system, right? So you start off with 10 points. And the more guesses you take, the less points you get. So I think on yours, we would have got like eight points, right? But I was having more fun doing the opposite. Movie like really scrambling to get like-- so maybe a house rule. I thought it was way more fun. So for instance, when Novi was up-- Oh. So Novi had an under-ocean scene. Novi thinks in old school movies, right? So just picture Atlantis. He had the perfect vision of Atlantis. Like a statue in the middle, shark swimming. It looked like a lost civilization. And what was this word? Soup. [LAUGHTER] And everything got us-- every hieroglyphic, like nothing really-- only one of them really matched. It was-- Oh, wasn\\'t it like the-- it was kind of like a spiral? Yes. That was soup. And that was like-- No, every symbol of soup. Damn. That\\'s what it was. Yeah. And he was just like-- so we\\'re playing it. And we\\'re like, man, I don\\'t even know what he\\'s talking about. And I guess at one point, I said it out loud, right? Because I made a joke. I\\'m like-- I\\'m like-- because at one point, I\\'m like, I don\\'t know what this is. Oh, because we said like shark fin soup or something like that. Yes. Like as a joke. Yes. And that\\'s what it was. [LAUGHTER] So really, that really advocates different people think differently. And Novi was going very abstract. He didn\\'t realize it had to be as simple as possible. Like me, I\\'m just a simple person. So I thought, battle right away. And I actually wanted it to be a little bit harder, because I thought we would have more fun doing that. Or more fun guessing. Right? The more guesses, the more fun you\\'re going to have. So that\\'s why I thought it was going to be hard, but it wasn\\'t. And then Novi actually thought it was going to be easy. [LAUGHTER] But it was totally not easy. But I saw where he was going. I mean, you got to know the person too, right? And how they make those assumptions and jokes. And it just played out differently. But I think all four of us had a great time playing it. It was very satisfying, the rounds you played. Yeah, I think if one person gets to be the author and expert in a game, then that\\'s pretty satisfying. Yeah. And I also think that we had that sweet spot of four players. I don\\'t know if more than five or six, I don\\'t know if that would be as much fun. Because again, you\\'re going to have people muted. It\\'s just wavelength, right? You\\'re going to have people muted as they\\'re trying to talk. Two seem like it was too few, because you don\\'t have enough ideas flying around, right? Because it\\'s just you and the other person. You can\\'t talk to the other person. So those are my thoughts. I thought it like three, four, maybe five would be a nice sweet spot for the game. Right. I agree. But I had a blast. That was awesome. Very fun. I\\'ve noticed that Roland Wright\\'s are kind of becoming the treading again. Whoa. A lot of games coming out. Don\\'t you say that. Don\\'t say what? I\\'m just kidding. No, they are. They are. What games have you noticed? What games have kind of popped? Like every game is a Roland right now, dude. Like \"Railroink,\" \"Welcome to King Domino-Duel.\" Let\\'s explore a little bit of history behind Roland Wright\\'s. So the first Roland Wright that was commercially successful was actually Yatsi. Have either of you played Yatsi? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I haven\\'t. Actually, that was like one of the first games that my wife and I bought when we started our board game collection was Yatsi. Really? That\\'s pretty cool. Did you also play the very first Roland Wright that is on board game geek ranked 18,836? Clearly not. A spare time bowling from 1940? Apparently that\\'s-- We should see if we can get a copy of that. Actually, its rating is 3.9. So it can\\'t be very good. But hey, whatever. Let\\'s say it\\'s history, right? I would love to play that. That\\'d be hilarious. So Yatsi came out in 1956. So the story, whether this is true or not, is a Canadian couple. Oh, Canada. Hey, Canadian. We\\'re on a boat, and they needed a game to play. So do either of you know the other name, Priyazi, or another name for it? Nope. Poker dice. So the game\\'s very similar to poker dice. Yeah, so the game is similar to poker dice, right? You roll dice, and then you have ones, two, three, fours, fives, and sixes. And then you have full house. You have three of a kind, four of a kind, high, low run. So what you do is you roll the dice, and then you have a score sheet. And as you try to get the highest combinations of each one. So, you know, if you have two sixes and three fives, that might be your full house. Once you mark off a section for scoring, then you can never use that section again. And it\\'s very simple. Like you just roll dice. You actually have three rolls. So you roll the dice once. You can keep dice, roll again, keep dice, roll again. So if you\\'re trying to get like as many ones as possible, or a Yatsi, which is five, which is five, you know, you can do that. You could try to aim for different goals. And it kind of, there\\'s a little bit of luck involved. It\\'s not as like counting cards like poker, but there is a little bit of math to figure out what in six chance of getting whatever you need. And then write it down. So it is like a very, very classic game that is making a comeback. - That\\'s good. Yeah, like, I\\'ve noticed too, like I\\'ve been at my parents\\' house. They just bought a copy of Yatsi. - Really? - Like recently. - Yeah, I don\\'t know. - Apparently. - Like, yes. - There is a weird stat. - In the package. - When I was looking up this history stuff, it\\'s like they sell two million copies of Yatsi a year. I\\'m like. - What are those classic games, man? - Yeah, but it\\'s like if you sell two million copies of Yatsi a year, I feel like everyone in the world is gonna have a copy of a copy of Yatsi after like 100 years. - Is this like your 40 part? - Well, you also have those like advocates, right? That might actually buy like those collector editions, those different boxes, maybe wooden boxes or something, you know? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The collectors really is what they are. Or they have the original, they have a game of Yatsi, but they\\'re like, oh, I could get this better version. Yeah, I kind of get it. I mean, it is a fun game. But so looking back at that Yatsi, you know, some of the issues that I saw with it was that there\\'s not that much player interaction. So when I\\'m taking my turn, the other person is not really doing anything. They\\'re just kind of sitting there. Maybe they\\'re thinking about what they need, but they\\'re not really interacting with you. And I think that that is one thing that\\'s changing. To emphasize that, I looked up the top roll and rights currently on board game geek. So thank you board game geek for supplying us with so much stats by supplying, you just go on their site. So actually the first five, we\\'ve either are on our radar or we played them, which is kind of neat. So the first one ranked at 121 is welcome to. - That\\'s a great game. That\\'s a great game. - So how is that different than our Yatsi, you know, simple roll dice right down? - So in welcome to your trying to build your perfect neighborhood. So your paper that you have, it\\'s a row of streets. And basically what you\\'re trying to do is place the addresses from lowest to highest number, and then add in like pools, parks, fences, and stuff like that along the way. But instead of dice, you draw cards, and the cards have an address number and like a feature, whether that\\'s like a pool or a forest or something where you can manipulate the addresses to better suit your needs. There\\'s still not a ton of player interaction in it, but what\\'s cool is you also have these like side objectives where you know, you might have to get six houses in a row with like in like a fence area. And there\\'s three of those. And basically once one person gets it, no one else can. So you\\'re kind of trying to compete to get all these bonus points at the end. So you have to be strategic as to what you\\'re trying to achieve in that objective spot, as well as trying to fill up your card to maximize your points. - Huh, that\\'s pretty cool. So like, so between turns a player isn\\'t actually doing anything. They\\'re just kind of like waiting. - No, you do everything simultaneously. - Oh, so I was doing it together. - Right. - Okay, so there\\'s no talking. (laughs) - I mean, you can talk, but it\\'s not like, you\\'re talking about what you\\'re doing. - You\\'re very into the, yeah. - I feel like you\\'d be very into the turn, right? - Right. - Drawing, writing. (laughs) I break it all into two things. - I don\\'t know if you guys were thinking this. It just actually popped in my head while we were talking about it. - A lot of regular board games aren\\'t rolling rights. Get a lot of flack when you have to use dice, because it\\'s all just luck of the throw, right? - Yeah. - So how does that really affect, like why do you think rolling rights are, do you think maybe that\\'s why rolling rights are rolling color and are drawn right instead of just using all dice? - Oh, yeah. I don\\'t think that has much to do with it. I think people complain about luck because they wanna have more skill when they\\'re doing things. Like, I don\\'t know, when I play a game, like I don\\'t really, I actually like the dice base games. That element of luck kind of gives you a million different possibilities. Whereas like, you know, when you play a game that has an outcome and you know the outcome, it\\'s not as interesting, right? Like you can get up to a point where the outcome is pretty obvious. You\\'re gonna lose or you\\'re gonna win or you know what cards you have to play. And that\\'s great, but at the same time it doesn\\'t change the course of a game. Like, I guess you\\'re saying that, you\\'re also gonna remember people love Dungeons and Dragons. And Dungeons and Dragons is all dice based. - True. - So, you know, it\\'s always the luck of the dice. Yeah, sometimes you\\'re rolling 20s. Sometimes you\\'re rolling one. Sometimes you have loaded dice that all they do is roll 20s, you know? And that\\'s, and that\\'s the thing. Like people like that, right? So I actually think people like rolling dice. I think this is in our nature to have that randomness. - So you\\'re one of those street dice people, Amat? - Yeah. - All my dice are loaded. (laughing) - Well, you, Kat, what do you think? You played a little D in D with us. - I mean, the randomness and the dice are necessary. \\'Cause if not, then you didn\\'t, like you said, you\\'d have a really straight course. You\\'d get straight forward. You know, if I do the, if I do ABC and D, then I will win. Or if I miss a set, I do ABC, skip D, \\'cause I fail to do something in a path and then jump to E, then I lose. So the dice adds a randomness factor to it so that your whole game isn\\'t just strictly based upon, hey, you guys, like you and Matt and John are experts and know all these board games. And then if I were to jump in, I know nothing, next to nothing. And then I would just pretty much like, well, I mean, on that note, Kev, like you\\'re completely right. You know, I\\'m the rules person. I read all the rules all the time. And a lot of what I, like, not that I\\'m like trying to win, but I tend to win because I already know (laughing) the strategies I need to have, right? Like, while everyone else is just roll a dice to try to figure out what\\'s going on. - Yeah, but then it gives you a chance to come back and make, like, a strong move if you do have a good role. Like I say, I do roll a 20. It\\'s like, all right, I do a critical. And then I, you know, take out your guy in D&D or something along those lines. So it is a necessary factor. The randomness is, it keeps it fun. It keeps it interesting. - So the other games, that\\'s pretty clever by Wolfgang Varrish. The Studio by Stronghold Games is sitting at rank 133. After that, 233 is cartographers or role player tale. So it\\'s really popular due to its Steel Dijar nomination. And then twice as clever sitting at 434. So I actually have played twice as clever, and that\\'s pretty clever by both Gang Varrish, The Studio by Stronghold Games. That you can actually play online too. I think last week, well, before our podcast, I sent both of you the link to it. And you could just randomly play it. It\\'s, those two games are like Yatsi on steroids. So instead of, instead of trying to roll for poker things, like, you know, form a kind, as many ones as possible, you\\'re actually, you actually roll dice. And then you choose one of the six dice that you rolled. All the ones lower than that get put on like a silver platter. The one you chose goes, it\\'s now taken away. And then you roll the leftover dice. And you have both three of those rolls per turn. And then basically you\\'re filling out these, sorry, you\\'re filling out these five play areas. And each play area basically determines how much points you have at the end of your game. So the one thing I did find of that game, so I played that with Samantha, was that there wasn\\'t a lot of interaction between rounds. There was a little, there was a little. So when you roll the, so after your turns over, whatever dice are on the tray, the other players can then choose one for their board. Which is a very common mechanic you see nowadays with rolling rights. - Cool. - Real quick, what\\'s the Spiel DeGarr award that you guys are talking about? - It\\'s a Game of the Year award coming out of Germany. Basically it\\'s like one of the highest awards that a board game can get. - Spiel DeGarr is like a governing excellence award body. Like they look at all the board games and they decide what is one of the top games of the year. They based on a lot of different things like innovation and art concepts. Is it accessible? Is it family or into things like that? And they say that any game that wins the award or even gets nominated expects like a huge jump in sales. And we\\'ve already seen that. Like the crew, the quest for plant nine was a fantastic game and was nominated, I don\\'t know if it won. I think they did announce the winners recently, but it already like just being nominated had a huge jump in sales, which was incredible and became like a very popular part of board game geek, their hot list. - I don\\'t think they\\'ve done the winners yet. - I heard Hedgehog roll one kids game maybe. Maybe they did kids game. - Speedy roll one, the kids game. - There we go. Oh, so yeah, kid children\\'s game of the year. - Right, so maybe they haven\\'t done the other ones. Maybe they\\'re just doing them slowly. - Yeah, so I mean, the top four games, we played three of them and cartographers is on my list to play, I mean, we just haven\\'t, I just can\\'t get a copy of it. We\\'re stuck here at Canada, so I can\\'t get any of the shift to my into the office. So we\\'re just like, oh. But that\\'s pretty clever, twice as clever I played, you played welcome to. I did actually get to play a game recently that I really like. It\\'s called Roland, Roland, Right. And I talked about it on one of our previous shows. - Hi everybody, this is Kevin. This is quick clarification \\'cause Matt\\'s goofball and didn\\'t mention this during the show. The game that he is referring to is Roland Right spelled R-O-L-A-N-D. Second word, W-R-I-G-H-T. Not to be confused with the genre, roll and right, which is the topic of the show. All right, back to the show. - And it is a roll and color, which is super cool. So you have six dice, you roll them, you group them out, and then you being the person who rolled gets to choose whatever color you want. You then take that out of the dice pool, you put a little mark on your board, and then everyone else gets to choose from the leftovers. So whatever color\\'s the leftover, many several players can pick the same dice. After they\\'ve chosen their dice, everyone gets an action, and the actions are super cool. You just erase a dot on your board, and it lets you do different abilities. So you might be able to draw more cards. And the whole idea is that you\\'re creating patterns on your board to satisfy these cards you draw could be excellence or it could be equipment. And once you complete those, you then get points, or you get more abilities. And the whole idea is you\\'re a board game designer trying to create a board game, and it\\'s super fun, super easy, super cute. My wife obviously noticed the dog on it and fell in love. And it actually has solo mode too, which has its own separate solo board. You play over 21 rounds. I had a blast, I played it last night actually. I thought it was super fun. I actually liked it better than that\\'s pretty clever, and twice as clever. I haven\\'t played welcome to, but I can tell you it\\'s better than those two games, in my opinion, and I would love to see it rise a little higher than it is, so. - Cool. - So it\\'s cool about the Roland Wright\\'s game too, because they\\'re pretty accessible and pretty easy to play pretty much out of the box. I see a lot of games jumping in digital as well. - Oh yeah, they\\'re perfect for digital, perfect, right? Like a dice rolling mechanic, or in this case, just color, you just tap a dot. I don\\'t know if they have one. By the way, that\\'s by perplexed games if you\\'re interested in purchasing a Roland Wright. I highly recommend it. - Yeah, I was gonna say, \\'cause there was a game when you were at PAX, oh no, maybe when you were at GenCon, I don\\'t remember. Maybe when you were at GenCon, I wanted you to pick up the game on tour for me. - Oh yeah. - I was a gen con. - I didn\\'t hear a GenCon or PAX though, but what was cool with that, they were offering, oh, it\\'s a little while ago, I think it was like a free download as their app. So I\\'ve been playing that, and I think that\\'s super cool too. So like in that game, you\\'re a band manager trying to plan out the best tour route for your band. So using dice rolls, you roll two dice, so say if I get like a five and a seven, so I can put like 57 or 75. So I put those two numbers down on a dot, and you wanna make sure that your tour goes from lowest number to highest number, and you wanna try to get to as many spots as possible. So you wanna make sure that you\\'re putting, you know, higher numbers somewhere else, lower numbers somewhere else. It\\'s actually really cool. It\\'s actually really difficult. - Is it a solo gamer? Is it like a multiplayer? - I think you can play a multiplayer, the board game, but I played, obviously the app is solo. - Yeah, it was really fun. So I think that\\'s really cool. It\\'s nice little jump to digital, \\'cause it\\'s super easy. I know like Yazzi\\'s got an app and all that stuff as well, so. - Okay, so we discussed a bunch of different games, and they\\'re like roll and ride or draw and ride or roll and color. Is there anywhere we can see this going? Like could there be another mechanic that they\\'re just not seeing that maybe comes to our mind? - Dude, I\\'m not gonna say that, \\'cause it\\'s like get rich quick scheme. - Well, I mean, you got-- - Well, you got drawn right, you got roll and color. - You melted it to me. - Yeah. Oh, that game? Okay. - I don\\'t know, what do you think? - I don\\'t know, I just threw it out there. I mean, I guess-- - Trying to get my intellectual property, I see. - Yeah, well, I mean, you\\'re the same group. - Yeah, I don\\'t know, I bet like, I bet someone will figure out another mechanic and then obviously everyone will kind of copy it or play off of it, but. - I thought the drawn color was super creative. - I\\'m sure it\\'s been done, but it was super creative. A lot of fun. - Yeah, well, I like too, like I mentioned earlier, King Domino duel. It is rolling right, but what you\\'re doing is you\\'re rolling and you\\'re drawing the symbols. - So, hold on, so I don\\'t know anything about King Domino. So what is that, what is that like, and then how do that morph? - Like the original game King Domino? I actually haven\\'t played that, but what I know from it is you have a castle in the middle and you pull tiles, different color tiles, and you\\'re trying to lay tiles down as close as possible to your castle, but you\\'re trying to lay it down kind of in like a Domino fashion. So say I pulled like a yellow and a blue, I would have to put that down, and if I pulled like a blue and a green, I would have to have the blue against a blue tile. - I have a question for you, are you sure you haven\\'t played it? Sounds like you know, sounds like you\\'ve played it. - I haven\\'t played it. - I just looked at the box, I was looking at the box today at a store, so. - Oh really? - And then King Domino dual, it\\'s the same sort of layout, you have a castle in the middle, and you have all these shields on your pad of paper, and you roll, you roll four die, and I think your opponent takes two, and you take two, and you have to draw the symbol that\\'s on that shield until your sheet\\'s filled up. And then on the back, there\\'s like, if you come up with certain amount of combos and stuff, you get like those bonus points, and then those points are taken away from, and your opponent can\\'t use those bonus points in their game and stuff like that. - Oh, that\\'s pretty cool. Yeah, so obviously you had a chance to buy both of them, but you chose the dual, right, the King Domino roll and write dual. So what kind of like pushed you towards buying that? - Well, it\\'s like half the price of the original game. - So right away, it\\'s cheaper. - It\\'s cheaper, and then I feel like it\\'s just like a little bit more easy to explain, I guess, it\\'s just like out of the role, I find rolling right is pretty easy to play, you can open it up, and just by what you get, you can kind of see how you play. - Yeah, you roll dice. - You know what I mean? - And then do whatever it says, basically. - Exactly. - That\\'s cool. - Yeah, no, I definitely, I mean, King Domino\\'s a very big game, it\\'s very popular. I\\'m glad to hear that King Domino duel was very good. - Yeah, it was cool, I liked it. - Awesome. - So guys, I just wanted to kind of like, step away from our topic a little bit, and wanna give a shout out to something I thought was like really cool over the last week. You know, with everything going on in the world, we have the pandemic going on still, we have all the protests for the Black Lives Matter movement. Something that came out of that that I found was really awesome was I saw on, I go, I\\'m on one of a board game spotlight on Facebook, and James Hudson, who is a person who runs Druid City Games, and he\\'s part of the Skybound Games company. He put a thing out there saying like, hey, there\\'s this board game that is really good, and it is by a black board game creator, and it\\'s called Rap Gods, let\\'s sell them out. Let\\'s buy all their games. So with that sentence, I don\\'t know if he\\'s the one that started, but he\\'s the post that I saw. I went in, I started diving, you know, doing a deep dive into what\\'s going on, what\\'s this game about. So I purchased the game, so I\\'m pretty excited about that, but they ended up selling 653 copies of this game. - Wait, sorry, 600? - 653 copies of this game. So they sold completely out on their website, but what was awesome about it was that there were people on I think like Twitter and stuff that was saying, if you purchase this game, send me your receipt, and I\\'ll donate X amount of money to different charities for the Black Lives Matter movement. And can you guess how much money they raised? - You said 600 games? - 653 games. - Well, the game is about 100 bucks. - No, it was only like 50. - So $3,000? (laughing) - That\\'s just a quick map. - They ended up raising $80,916. - Oh, that\\'s awesome. That\\'s really awesome. - That\\'s really awesome. - Sweet. - I mean, you know, that says a lot about the board game community in general. We\\'ve been very fortunate to be involved over the last year, but it\\'s very inclusive and very like together, like it\\'s very close, right? And for that to happen, that\\'s awesome. - Yeah, so I don\\'t know who started that. I know James was the post that I saw, where I purchased the game from, but like, man, I just think that\\'s so cool. Within a week, they sold out all our copies of their game. - And it\\'s a good game too, like, to be honest with you, it\\'s a really good game. It\\'s a good game and it\\'s an awesome cost, so it\\'s fantastic. - That\\'s why I was pretty excited about the share with you guys today. - Cool. - Cool. - So that\\'s awesome though. Show some solidarity community within board game community and support those developers who are trying to get noticed and get out in the world and then also support some other great cars. So that\\'s awesome. - Yeah. - There is a lot of money and stuff sweet. - So thank you all for listening.

Yeah that\\'s what I\\'m, it\\'s bonus time. Welcome to the Not Politically Correct podcast. Ah, nothing like a little start from the Beastie Boys there, right? - Yeah. - Man, we kinda accidentally got the Beastie Boys in on our last show. Wow, what a week, man. - Yeah. - And this whole, Georgia. Floyd. - Floyd, thank. How many funerals do you really need? - I would say enough to make you a showcase and the laughs. What are they even trying to make this guy? - My next question is, have any of them been open casket? - Oh no. I feel like the answer is no, but if you\\'re in a gold casket, it\\'s such a, dude, it\\'s crap, it\\'s propaganda. We all know it\\'s propaganda. It even looks like propaganda. - Like I said though, you get after and you get the lookin\\'. And Facebook is doin\\' everything you can to keep me from gettin\\' \\'em out. These videos, there\\'s multiple videos dealing with Floyd\\'s death. - There are good questions. - And they\\'re questioning a lot of things. - There\\'s some weird videos goin\\' on, man. I don\\'t even know. - That one was like 12 minutes. And it pointed out a lot of things that didn\\'t make sense. Like, why didn\\'t the paramedics show up when they were called and tried to reviving? They just walked over, looked and left in this video. - That\\'s a little weird. - And then the state-how patrol loaded him on a stretcher and put him in the back of the ambulance. - No, that\\'s what the paramedics are there for. - The whole thing\\'s a little weird. - You know, there\\'s a lot of weird things goin\\' here, which brings the question, is he really dead? - I mean, as much of me wants to go, no, this isn\\'t a conspiracy. The more video I watch, the more I do sort of have to question it. And that, you know me, I don\\'t automatically jump on the conspiracy, but the videos are becoming more and more possible, maybe. - Plausibility, maybe? - Oh, I don\\'t know. - What about the sheriff out in California? Just the other night on national TV made a statement. We need to dig in to find more into the relationship between the cop and Mr. Floyd. Because, you know, he said, \\'cause I have a feeling there\\'s much more to this story than we\\'re being told. That brings back to what I came off with last week. - Oh, I remember, I unfortunately do remember. - And like I said, that was more of an execution than it was anything else. And if they can prove a connection and it would come back to what I said, then yeah, that\\'s murder one. - No, I\\'m goin\\' back down the path. All right, here it comes. - I\\'m thinking they may have overcharged it at this point, they may not get a conviction. - But did they want to get a conviction? What we know is the prosecutor is a major contributor and backer of the Antifa movement. Now, if you overcharge the guy and then you\\'re unable to prove it and the charges get dismissed or he\\'s found not guilty, they\\'re gonna riot again. But if you\\'re a hardcore Antifa supporter, wouldn\\'t you want to overcharge the guy to ensure that to everybody you did the best you could, but he was found not guilty based on the grounds to charge him with the particular thing you did. And if you wanted to continue to sow sabotaging chaos, then maybe you would do that on purpose. - Yeah. I mean, that\\'s my thinking. - You know, if they get the murder one, I think that\\'s where you end up, for sure. I know you\\'re not gonna get him on a murder one. - They had him at three though. - They had him at three. - With an impraved indifference, they had it. - And I think that\\'s why they moved it up to a two to ensure that they didn\\'t get a conviction. But then reasonably speaking, let\\'s go the next step. Even if you do convict him on murder two. - What if you acquit the other cops? - Oh no, it\\'s even worse than that. You ready? You get him on murder two. He appeals. You bring out all the information that the prosecutor is a giant antifa member. They\\'re gonna overturn that case. Because that would show bias of the prosecutor no question about it, no doubt about it. No matter what, they\\'re gonna overturn that conviction. And once again, you have rioting. So basically no matter how this ends, rioting, burning of cities. - How about open season? - You know, I basically, this whole thing has just gone down a crazy path. And I don\\'t even know what, oh man, I don\\'t even know what\\'s really going on. You know what I mean? - Well, I think I do though. - Okay, what do you think? - I think they\\'ve got the playbook out for agenda 21 and they\\'re trying to implement it. Man, I hated agenda 21. - But that\\'s what I think\\'s going on. I think this is the start of them trying to implement agenda 21. - I mean, you already got Congressman and stuff calling on the UN to help us get rid of our guns. - Oh please, please, let\\'s do that. Let\\'s just do that. I think it\\'s a great idea. Please bring the UN. It\\'s fine. You know the difference-- - That would be the grounds for war, wouldn\\'t it? \\'Cause that would actually be a foreign army on our soil. - Well, you know, in our other show we talked about the reasons why the South essentially lost the Civil War and it was because of excessive restraint, which doesn\\'t make them bad, it made them naive. I can assure you I will have absolutely no restraint. None whatsoever, not even a little bit. The days of gentlemanly combat have long passed. Now it\\'s going to be more like being in Cambodia. Have a good time. Just pointing that out. But yeah, you want to bring the UN? Let\\'s do this. You want to bring, I don\\'t really care who you bring. Let\\'s just do it. I\\'m done. I\\'m done. We\\'ve drifted so far off of where we started as a nation. It\\'s not even funny. You know, we have fake narratives running everywhere. (coughing) I\\'m just coughing to death. Oh, coughing, that makes me think of the coronavirus. - Mm, scam. - Yeah. Yep, the scammedemic. Biggest freaking scam in world history. - Yes, it was. - It really was. The reports do show that, that drug that I can\\'t ever say the name of works. - Hydro-crosoquine. - Oh, I know that\\'s not the name of it. What in the world are you doing to your phone? - Cleaning up the microphone. - Oh. - I just down half the holes were plugged up. - Well, so you want to make sure that the Google can hear you better? - Yeah. - Oh, okay, cool. - You know, since they got me banned. - They definitely got you banned. They banned you so bad from Facebook, it\\'s not even funny. - I mean, they got me, I can\\'t touch the page right now. - No, no, you really can\\'t do anything to it. - I guess I can start up a new Facebook page and then go to it through something else. - Yeah, they\\'re gonna ban you. They\\'ve got your account flagged. Any page you open, they\\'re gonna ban it. - Well, I\\'ll just do it under an assumed name. - Oh, okay, well, that\\'s fine. I mean, cool, yeah. - Good under my grandson. - Oh my gosh. - You know, his middle name\\'s Lee. - Oh, well, then, yeah, telling me you want him to run the page. - Yeah. - Let him run the page. It\\'s a great idea. Smart kid, let him run it. That\\'d be awesome. We\\'ll have a way bigger social media presence than we do now. - Yeah. - So, you know, we keep looking at all this different stuff. Have you seen this craziness going on with, okay, I always get the two papers confused. There\\'s the New York Times and the New York Post, which is the ultra-left one. - Times. - Okay, so let me tell you about the Times. They have been firing editors non-stop because you have a bunch of leftist editors but you have a bunch of woke 20 and 30-year-olds and they\\'re firing these editors for not being diverse and sensitive enough. - Yeah, it\\'s times. - Yeah, yeah. It is a fabulous thing if you wanna see what happens when the left starts eating their own and that is what\\'s essentially happening at most of these media outlets. Oh, you\\'re just not left enough. Well, you\\'re not woke enough. This is going on non-stop and it is hilarious to watch. It\\'s really a funny thing. I think it\\'s hilarious. I\\'ve never imagined that they would bash them so much. Did you hear the thing about JK Rowling? Yeah, she\\'s getting bashed for apparently not being transensitive enough. What the hell is that? Who knows? - Exactly. - You know, this world is just totally upside down. There\\'s really weird crap. Like we talked on our other show. We talked about Planned Parenthood coming out with their Black Lives Matter thing. Isn\\'t that the number one kill demographic? - Yeah. - Okay, I was just checking to be sure that it was for-- - Ben, since day one. - Yeah, didn\\'t, it was Margaret Sanger. Isn\\'t she the one who referred to the Black race as being like weeds or similar thing to that? - Yeah, I forgot what it was. - If you dig through her quotes, you will find that she is a eugenics genocidal fascist. Okay, yeah, y\\'all just keep believing what you want to believe. Have you guys ever, have you dug in? I know you\\'ve dug in. You ever get on Black Lives Matter and read a little bit about what the organization actually stands for? - Well, I know half the people out there protesting have no idea. - Would just research Black Lives Matter, they wouldn\\'t be out there protesting. - I think it\\'s hilarious watching all of these quote, woke soccer mom Karens wanting to be like, \"Yeah, Black Lives Matter.\" And you have no idea what the group even stands for. You know, we\\'ve talked about this earlier and we were like, \"Look, I think our hashtag was what?\" All Lives Matter? - Yeah. - Oh, well that\\'s racist. Okay, whatever. The Black Lives Matter group, you want to dig into something that\\'s actually a really bad idea? Dig into them just a little bit and you\\'ll find out that they are for distribution of wealth. They are for gun control. They are for removing history. Unless it fits their narrative. And they\\'re for a socialist utopia. None of those things are going to work. - It\\'s messy. - Yep. - You\\'ve got Antifa running around being funded by George Soros by way of Black Lives Matter. Whatever that is, you\\'ve got Black Block, which you\\'ve, have you dug into them? - No, I have not. - Okay, Black Block is apparently the militant version of Antifa. They\\'re a real mess. - I\\'m sure they\\'re funded by Soros. - Oh, I\\'m sure everything that is on fire is being funded by Soros. They have their professional rioters going out and enticing crowds to-- - The professional brick delivers. - Seriously. Like, here\\'s a pile of bricks. Here\\'s a pile of gravel. Look at that. It\\'s right where we were going to stage anyhow, isn\\'t it? - Oh, maybe we should use them. Ooh, let\\'s throw them at something. What? - But can you believe it? They bought them from the Acme Brick Company. - Oh my gosh. - Hilarious. - But yet, Elmer Fudd can\\'t have his Acme shotgun. - Yeah, what\\'s up with that? - Well, you know, it makes them feel good. They finally banned the gun. - Good grief. And I am guessing Yosemite Sam and the little Martian guy don\\'t have their guns either. - Nope, Martian gets to keep his. - Why is that? - \\'Cause it\\'s a space gun. - Oh! - His gun shoots laser beams, remember? - Oh, so as long as I spend a lot of money on R&D and I create a laser gun, technically speaking, a laser gun would not meet the grounds to be considered a firearm by the ATF. - That\\'s true? - Huh, well, that\\'s not a bad idea. So I guess I would call it what, a Tesla gun? - It uses, fires a lightning bolt? - Man! (laughing) - Yeah, Yosemite Sam, I don\\'t think they\\'ve gone after him yet. - Oh. - I thought he got banned altogether. - He may have. - \\'Cause of his southern roots. - Oh, I\\'m sure he did. - Did you happen to see where they\\'re going after the little dog on pal patrol? - Yeah, pal patrol, yeah. - Yeah. - They\\'ve canceled cops after 30-some years? - They canceled live PD and here\\'s what kind of pissed me off about that. Live PD has more episodes that portray the cops in a much more positive light. Oh, that\\'s why they banned them. Nevermind, I just figured it out. - Yep. - Nevermind, I know why they got banned. - Cancelled, canceled, nothing. - Well, whatever. You know it\\'s not gonna show up on Ray Run, so I feel like it\\'s banned. - Huh, I wonder, let\\'s see, going with the wind is gone. - Until they can figure out how to put in clips to racial diversity. - Are you freaking kidding me right now? - I think that\\'s what they said. - Good God, that\\'s the dumbest thing I ever heard. - You know, going with the wind isn\\'t, you wanna ban something, ban Django Unchained. - Yeah, you know. - That\\'s a total spite dream shit show. - The whole thing is, going with the wind as we were talking earlier, is probably more factually accurate. - Yes. - Than what\\'s being taught in schools. - Absolutely it is. It\\'s probably more accurate than the history classes are today. - No, I would say so. History classes are predominantly taught by revisionist historians, or even worse, they\\'re taught by people who\\'ve never actually learned real history, so they\\'re just regurgitating the revisionist history that they were taught. - Huh, what a mess, yeah. - What, a total mess. Man, yeah, I mean, did you see Tom\\'s face when we were going down the list of things? - Yeah. - He\\'s going, why wasn\\'t I taught that in school? - Well, because they didn\\'t wanna teach you that in school because, well, I can sit on Facebook and look at all the people who didn\\'t learn anything in history class \\'cause they weren\\'t taught it. The Confederacy was not made up of traitors. They were actually the last group of people who were patriots of the last patriots who fought for the physical constitution. Now, don\\'t mince my words. I am not referring to modern conflicts that they were not patriots when they went and kicked the dog shit out of the Nazis. Yes, they were patriots. But the last group that physically fought for the constitution. - And our freedom. - In the continental United States between opposing armies in the continental United States were the Confederate States of America. They were the last ones. They had a constitutional right which was being violated by Abraham Lincoln and they were not going to stand for it. (mouse clicking) That\\'s the truth of what that breakdown is. I am appalled as I see these monuments, what\\'s left of them that weren\\'t destroyed last time being torn down by these rioting looters. It is disgraceful. The part where the cops just stand there and don\\'t do anything also pisses me off beyond all that\\'s believable. They are destroying historical property. Use lethal force. - They\\'re destroying the property of the citizens of the United States. - Exactly. - Protect it. The next person that tells me, well, the cops aren\\'t actually there to protect property. - Bullshit. - That\\'s... - 90% of what they do is property crimes. - You know, if you look at what they are, they are there to serve and to protect. That is what they say. - That\\'s what they say. - Well, \"protect\" means the protection of rights and property. - Yes, it does. - To serve is to assist. - Yes, it is. Very, very different. Very, very, very different. There is-- - But that way\\'s had you. - No, no, I haven\\'t. There is no reason that when you have a group of people attempting to loot your store, that you should not absolutely use the most lethal force you can come up with. - I am fine with using a cannon with grape shot. It\\'s historically accurate and effective. - Yeah? - And not banned by the NFA? (laughing) - Just thought. - Yeah. - I would really like to shoot like a, oh, just like a two pound cannon and put two pounds of BBs in it. - That would be interesting. I kind of want to try it. You think we should try it one day? We really need to add a video portion to this where we do some fun stuff. You know, some barbecuing, some cannon shooting. That might be scary. - It might be scary. Craig is banned from YouTube. (laughing) - Oh, well, we get banned from everything else. - Yeah, you know, I\\'m doing a good job with that on everything else. - Yeah, let\\'s just keep on getting banned. It\\'s kind of where we\\'re at now, but what do you do? - Yeah, you know. You know, this whole ban thing really does have me blown away. The source I used was the liberal New York Times. - Yes, it was. - And the New York Times said that hydro-corquin or Halberts pronounced was the most successful drug in the treatment of this virus. Which it is. - Yes. - And somehow that is not up to their standards that I did that. But yet the New York Times still allowed to have that same article up. - Strange. - So it\\'s only against their standards if I post it, because they\\'re just looking for any reason to get rid of me. - Very weird. - So I\\'ll just have to send, when I find good stuff, I\\'ll send it in you and you can post it. - Okay, I\\'ll do that. - \\'Cause I don\\'t think they banned you from posting to the site. - No, they haven\\'t. - I think it\\'s just me, it\\'s gotten banned. - I don\\'t really know how, I\\'m actually looking right now to try to see if it says anything about how you got banned. But it\\'s just not saying anything. - Well, mine had said, the administrators have decided to limit your access. I have to find that back. - Yeah, I\\'m actually on our page right now and it\\'s not really telling me a whole lot. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think we got a new, oh, you guys are in trouble again. Let\\'s see here. Yep, wow. People really hate us, don\\'t they? - Oh, what we do. - I don\\'t know, but we\\'re down to three out of five stars. - Oh yes, we have a Karen or two out there. Everybody\\'s gotta have a Karen now. - All right, who is this Marie Lightman person? - I went to school with her. - Really, because she keeps posting negative reviews on our stuff. - Amazing. - Hmm, any chance we can, oh, there we go, ban from page. Yeah, confirm. Oh, look at that, we just ban somebody. That\\'s pretty cool. - To start? - Well, whoever that person is, Miss Karen, we just banned her. Let\\'s see, why? Hmm, I have to dig a little deeper and figure out how you got banned. We apparently shared, I shared something that wasn\\'t accurate according to them, despite the fact that it came from USA Today. - Another left lady. - Yep, that\\'s really kind of funny. You know, we should probably talk about our biggest sponsor, that our super sponsor. - We have a sponsor? - We do have a sponsor. And it is one of the tastiest sponsors you could ever have. - Smokin\\' buttsbbq.com, have you had it? Have you heard of it? Well, you have now. Smokin\\' buttsbq.com, your source for barbecue sauce, rubs and some of the best grilling supplies around. What is smokin\\' buttsbq.com? Well, let me help ya. It\\'s sauces and rubs, every sauce and every rub. Guess what it\\'s missing? High fructose corn syrup. It\\'s also missing gluten and MSG. And see, without those things, you have a pretty great sauce. You have a great rub. There\\'s a rub that I like to use on vegetables and I like to use it on pub chips. And it\\'s called sweet heat. It\\'s also really good. Now you gotta laugh at me. It\\'s really good on scrambled eggs. - No. - It\\'s really good. - Oh, I love that, yeah. - You do some peppers and onions with your scrambled eggs and then you put that over the top of it, it is glorious. If you\\'re listening to us and you\\'re like, man, I wanna try some sweet heat on my, my scrambled eggs, well, that\\'s cool. You can get on Smokin\\' Buttsbq.com and you can find a local retailer or if you\\'re one of our listeners in, I don\\'t know, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan, maybe Italy or the Dominican Republic, you back a stand. Basically, if you listen to us anywhere in the known world, you can just find what you want, put it in your cart, pay for it, and guess what? It\\'ll come to your house. In a box. So be sure to order some great stuff like, oh, I don\\'t know, habanero apple sauce. Not habanero apple sauce, but habanero and apple in a sauce. - Where are we using habanero apple? - Yes, even though I kinda wanna try a habanero apple bar, yeah, like-- - Apple sauce, I don\\'t say I\\'m-- - Yeah, I would go, I bet it\\'d be really good. - Hey, you know, I sit here and look at it too, I don\\'t know that bad. - I know, I might, I may just have to try that this week. - There\\'s also one of them. - I\\'ve thought about trying to inject, like, in a pork loin apple sauce. - Okay. - Instead of apple juice, go with apple sauce. - It would hang out longer. - Huh, just a thought. - That\\'s a pretty good idea. - Huh. Thanks, and I\\'m gonna think about that the rest of the daily. Really appreciate that. Anyway, check out our number one sponsor, SmokinBudsBBQ.com. - And if you\\'d like to be a sponsor of our radio show, or even this show. - Yeah, just shoot us a message on our Facebook page, not politically correct radio, and we can get you set up with some information on how to have your show mentioned on our show, have your store, your business, your chop shop, your armory, whatever it is you have, we\\'ll talk about it, we don\\'t care. It\\'s all good, got a tattoo shop that does really cool stuff, yeah, that\\'s cool, we\\'ll put you on. Not really a big deal. Let\\'s see, what else did we have for the way? There was something big, oh. Okay, so what\\'s the story? You know, the news has not talked about any of the hearings going on in DC. - Isn\\'t that amazing? - Yeah, so what do we get out of the Hillary Clinton hearing the other day? - She\\'s got to testify. - I heard that. - Ain\\'t that neat? - She\\'s gonna have to testify. Whatever happened with General Flynn? - Well, the, the ex judge, the retired judge, appointed by the judge, comes out and said, I don\\'t believe the federal government can do what they\\'re wanting to do. And they\\'re about go at it over that, so. - So why would you not just get another judge? - Well, I think they want to actually take this to the fruition and get it to court so they can slap him down. - Oh, and that\\'s the end of the judge. - Yeah, okay. - Wow. - I really think that\\'s the end goal is just to totally take him out. - I think that\\'s a great goal. He should not be a sitting judge. - Yeah, because. - No question about it. - You know, because if the prosecutor says, I don\\'t wish to move forward with charges, that\\'s normally the end of it. - Yeah, not, the judge doesn\\'t get to say no, you have to. - No. - The judge can\\'t say, I have enough here. I can take this far. - Right, no. - You see, it\\'s take off zero, but then become a prosecutor. - Right, and that also means that the judge now has prosecutory powers, which the judge never has prosecutory powers. You have to remember a judge in a case is simply a moderator. That is it. So the fact that this judge is attempting to legislate from the bench is a real issue. You see, some of the biggest messes we have in the United States are from judges legislating from the bench. Which, if you want to be a legislator, or a legislator, then by all means run and get elected and become a legislator, but you\\'re a judge. So take the case given to you and shut the hell up. Sit down and shut up. When the prosecutor doesn\\'t want to pure pursue charges, that\\'s the end of the case. - That\\'s it. - Yeah. - Well, you know, you have legislature, judicial, and executive. - Yep. - Each are supposed to be co-equal. - Yeah. - When the executive says, no, we are not going forwards with this case \\'cause this case was tainted. - That should be the end of it. - Yeah. - Like, that should be the total end of any action being taken by anybody. - But, Flynn\\'s lawyers want to see this to the end. So that, say, Trump somehow would not get elected, reelected, election fraud. - Yep. - They can\\'t come back and then retry this case. - That actually makes sense. - So, yes, they wanted this to come to an end. - Yeah. - You know, what they\\'re wanting to do is prosecuting for perjury because he entered a not guilty plea, or a guilty plea. - That\\'s the dumbest thing I\\'ve ever done. - But he should have entered, was probably an Alfred plea. - Probably. - Had he done an Alfred plea, but that wasn\\'t good enough for the prosecutors in this case. - No, it wasn\\'t. - But had he done an Alfred plea, there\\'d be no case whatsoever. \\'Cause an Alfred plea says, I do not. - It just means I don\\'t object to what you\\'re charging me with. - Well, basically what an Alfred plea says is, I\\'m not gonna admit I\\'m guilty, but a reasonable jury could probably find me guilty. - Oh, what? - That\\'s freaking mass. - But. - But how did we end up in this? Duh. - But that wasn\\'t good enough for prosecutors. He had this emit guilt. - Good. - He had to emit guilt, or his son was gonna get prosecuted next and bankrupted and destroyed. Well, what father wouldn\\'t do that to protect this kid if he liked it? - Good grief. What a bunch of raging idiots. - Huh. - So yeah, it\\'s Hillary. That\\'s the Flynn case. What else? I\\'m waiting to see this next prosecutor\\'s case. I believe people are gonna start getting charged here real quick. - Yeah. I think there\\'s gonna be a lot of people to get charged. - Which is fine. - Well, it\\'s gonna make interesting when they get Comey and these guys, Brennan and these guys start getting charged. - Oh yeah. - It\\'s gonna be interesting to see which rat jumps first. - Oh. - Oh, it\\'s gonna be so great. - And how far is it gonna go up the ladder? - I think it goes all the way. - I think it\\'s, I know it does go all the way. Will it get all the way up? - Man, I hope it does. I hope it goes all the way up. - I would love to see this get all the way to the former White House. - It\\'d be really fabulous if both Obama and Biden get charged. Because that would start setting examples for the rest of them in Washington. You might actually see Washington take note that the people have had enough. - Everybody\\'s had enough of this years of crap and deception and lies and blah, blah, blah. No, I agree. All right, Lee, you ready to bounce, man? - Yeah. - All right, you have been listening and not politically correct the podcast. Thank you for tuning in. We will talk to you again next week. Lee, take us home. - Everybody, get a copy of the Constitution. Read it. Go to theblaze.com. - Oh, yeah. - Look up, agenda 21. - Who? - Read about it. Watch the videos. Order, he even has a great book on tape, an audiobook. - Yes, he does. - Get the audiobook on agenda 21. Listen to it while you\\'re driving down the road. You won\\'t fall asleep. - No. - You just gonna get angry. You may have road rage. - As we mentioned that they are not one of our sponsors, but you should definitely consider looking up the Blaze TV that is the Mercury One network. You can watch it on your phone. You can download it and watch it on your TV. It\\'s just like Netflix or any of those. But there\\'s a lot of really great shows on there. - They have a lot of great history shows. - Great history shows. - Interfactual. - Yeah, it\\'s really good. So you can check out history stuff. They\\'ve got some shows that are like 60 minutes used to be where it was real investigative reporting. They\\'ve got some pretty funny shows like Stu Does America and some of these. Check, definitely check it out. I think right now they\\'ve a $10 off an entire year. So it makes it like $69 to have it for a whole year. It\\'s worth less than $6.90 a month to have the whole thing. - You know what? And you watch it instead of watching some of the network users. - Oh yeah. - Your blood pressure will probably go down. Your anger level will probably go down. - They definitely will and they\\'ve got some great guests on there. - Because you\\'re gonna get facts. - Yes. - And you\\'re not guessing is this second. You know, we like to tell people check us out. Verify what we tell you. - Oh yeah. - Because the more you check into us and the more you verify the more you find out, we\\'re giving you the facts. We\\'ve already done it. But we want you to check us out too. - Go find it for yourself. - Because why you still can? - Yeah, before it all disappears. Anyway, go find it. Learn. We will talk to you guys next week. - Bye now.', 'rssUrl': 'https://anchor.fm/s/b42a3dc/podcast/rss', 'epTitle': 'New day....new mess', 'epDescription': \"<p>O boy......</p>--- Support this podcast: <a href='https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/andrew-dodd/support' rel='payment'>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/andrew-dodd/support</a>\", 'mp3url': 'https://anchor.fm/s/b42a3dc/podcast/play/15141306/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-5-13%2F81982283-44100-2-f1bf6b18bdbe9.mp3', 'podTitle': 'Not Politically Correct Radio', 'lastUpdate': '2021-05-25 09:20:15', 'itunesAuthor': 'andrew dodd', 'itunesOwnerName': 'andrew dodd', 'explicit': 0, 'imageUrl': 'https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded/1789167/1789167-1557504858590-b6b4649043ebb.jpg', 'language': 'en', 'createdOn': '2020-08-12 02:22:27', 'host': 'anchor.fm', 'podDescription': 'It\\'s time for Liberty to be a buzz word again!

[Music] In this episode, an in-depth interview with neurosurgeon Professor Ian Flock on Tigerburg Hospital\\'s COVID-19 robots and why local medics believe the country needs to urgently open up again. There\\'s a warning by the actuaries at Panda that the unintended consequences of the lockdown will kill 29 times more people than the virus itself. We\\'ll have a look at how the new world of office work will be very different to the pre-COVID-19 norm and a message to struggling companies from a business rescue practitioner who advises them to take the tough decisions sooner rather than later. Inside COVID-19, from Biz News. [Music] In today\\'s COVID-19 headline, South Africa\\'s cases continue to rise but at a relatively modest rate with 236 new infections confirmed on Wednesday, that\\'s the third successive daily decline since Sunday\\'s 447, which is the highest daily number thus far. Total cases in South Africa reached 7,808 Wednesday, while a further 5 deaths took the total to 153. The Western Cape currently accounts for more than half the reported cases and deaths. By Wednesday night with more than 10,000 tests now being conducted daily, there has been a total of almost 280,000 tests in South Africa. Globally, by Thursday evening, WorldOmeter.info reported total coronavirus cases at 3.85 million and deaths at 266,000, with the United States accounting for around a third of global infections and a quarter of new deaths. The UK\\'s deaths now exceed 30,000 making it the second hardest hit nation on Earth, closely followed by Italy, then Spain and France. According to Johns Hopkins University, at 73 per 100,000 of population, Belgium is the worst hit of any nation, followed by Spain at 55, Italy at 49, UK at 45, and France at 38. The Netherlands is at 30 in the US at 22, that\\'s all, per 100,000 people in those countries. One of the few similarities between these nations is that none of them have had a sustained universal BCG vaccine regime. By contrast, BCG vaccinating neighbour Portugal has a per capital mortality rate, one-fifth of Spain\\'s, while the mortality rate in Mexico, a universal BCG vaccinator since 1951, is one-tenth of its non-vaccinating northern neighbour, the United States. South Africa\\'s horse-racing industry says it is on the brink of collapse, with 60,000 direct and indirect jobs likely to be lost, if the hard lockdown on the sector continues. The National Horse Racing Authority says, in addition, 400 horses a month face the prospect of being euthanised, if the suspension of racing persists. The industry is asking for just 15 minutes of racing per day to be introduced behind closed doors, with 65 people per course sufficient to ensure that eight races could be held, with all COVID-19 health and safety protocols followed. South Africa is the world\\'s eighth most important horse-racing market, that of 65 countries where the sport is held. It\\'s a significant exporter of thoroughbreds and a foreign exchange generator through its television broadcasting of races held here. In a study of 17.5 million UK adults, the largest such investigation, the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have concluded that irrespective of their financial situation, Asian and Black people have the highest mortality risk from coronavirus. It also confirmed through the study that men are at higher risk as well as older people and those with uncontrolled diabetes and severe asthma. The study which was done for Britain\\'s National Health Service linked patients that have been hospitalized through COVID-19 with their primary care records. The world\\'s largest entertainment company Walt Disney says the pandemic knocked operating income by $1.4 billion in the March quarter, a decline of 37%. It expects much worse in the three months to end June, saying the coronavirus brought practically every part of the Disney machine to a halt. In another reflection of the new post-coronavirus world, Uber and its smaller rival Lyft have both announced that they expect fewer passengers in future. In anticipation, Uber has already cut about 14% of its workforce. Lyft says it will be laying off 17% of its staff. Lyft reported that its ridership plunged 75% in April. Inside COVID-19 from this year\\'s. South Africa\\'s COVID-19 lockdown may cause 29 times more death than the virus. That is a stark message from pandemic, data and analytics or PANDER who have compiled a report that they\\'ve handed over to the presidency. The coordinator of PANDER, Nick Hudson, says the government\\'s mantra that the lockdown saves lives and that it is lives versus the economy is a false dichotomy. Poverty due to the lockdown could in the long run be a bigger killer than COVID-19. He explained to his news who PANDER was. PANDER is a collection of people who were concerned about the same thing and joined forces to see what could be done about it. We were very worried individuals just personally about the future of our country and we thought that the country was being placed at great risk. So what the guys have in common is an interest in addressing that problem but it\\'s obvious there\\'s some actual data scientists. There\\'s a doctor, there\\'s lawyer, so it\\'s a diverse group and with different skills which has helped. Doing that analysis had required a little bit of head scratching and how are we going to get a group on that kind of parameter and where are we going to get this kind of data. And so there\\'s a lot of effort from a lot of people working very hard for the sole purpose of trying to save our country from what we see as a very calamitous set of policy choices. What we thought was a fairly inane kind of argument that we can\\'t prioritize the economy over lives. Back into a domain that linked the economy back to lives and livelihoods and try to make it alive versus lives debate so that we can at least discuss it more rationally. So tell me exactly what you found in terms of the numbers. Well look, we push things around as hard as we could because the way we sort of set about doing it was we tried to, you know, our intuition was that lockdown was doing more harm than yours. But the thing to do then is to set up an experiment and say okay, proves that lockdown is working, you know, and let\\'s do the maths on that. And what we, you know, when you set up the actual numbers and say okay, well there\\'s the economic damages, what happens if we assume it\\'s only this much and that there are only this many jobs and that this many of them are permanently lost. And those people slide down the income scale, what happens to their mortality, how many life years do they lose in that process? We do the numbers, can we show that that number is lower than what is spared by, in theory, by the curve being fattened. And we couldn\\'t even get close. I mean on our best estimate numbers, it\\'s through the roof and the very conservative versions of the numbers which we put in our paper spell out that you lose 30 times as many as possible. So many times as many years of life from the economic impact, then you save from avoiding the hospital and the birth of the birth. So it\\'s an extreme story. Our numbers have to be out by a lot and by an implausible amount for the onset to be different. Shoe, sir, see you say the death toll from South Africa\\'s coronavirus outbreak this year could range between 46,088,000. It doesn\\'t matter our estimates, we\\'re just taking everybody else\\'s estimates. We don\\'t believe that they\\'re right and they\\'re not coming to be fair to any more. That\\'s a set of a model that\\'s going to be right in and very common. But we just took a range of other people\\'s estimates and applied the numbers to those because our own version tells a story that\\'s not as severe as that. But we didn\\'t want that to be the center of the argument. We weren\\'t trying to model the pandemic. So we just took the most extreme publicly available one and a lower one, about half that level. And then ran the numbers on those bases just to see what the range was. And even when we used that 88,000 assumption and therefore a much bigger hospital over the burdening problem, which then maximizes the benefit of lockdown, we still couldn\\'t get the numbers to come anywhere near the apparatus. So you\\'ve written a letter to President Sir O\\'Romeposa where you tell him that in the long run, the lockdown will cause more loss of life than the virus itself. Yes, we gave him our... we thought it was, you know, when you\\'re sitting on that kind of information, we tested it first. We went and pushed it past after. He just did nothing to do with the writing of the article. We tested it as a well-known acclaimed epidemiologist. And we took their comments on board, checked whether any of the issues they pointed to made any difference to the answer, tightened up our calculations in certain places, tightened up the wording in certain places. And then we still had that answer, so we thought, well, you can\\'t sit on this because each week of lockdown is probably taking more years of the life of the population than the virus itself. So what is going to happen to that report? Have you actually physically handed it over to somebody? Yes, it went to the presidency earlier in the week. I forget which day now. We\\'ve received a confirmation that they\\'ve got it and that they\\'ve pointed it in the direction of the appropriate people. I\\'d imagine that would be the command council. I don\\'t know. Yeah, and then we\\'ll see what they have to say. But the report\\'s been generally very well received. I think it\\'s telling people what they already knew. You know, it\\'s quite simply that poverty kills people, you know, and that resetting up a whole lot of poverty here. What would your advice be to the government in light of these figures? My advice would be that we should move to a kind of smarter lockdown. If you like ending this very oppressive economic lockdown, I think would make sense for children to go back to school. I think you can open up the whole economy and start doing some cheaper sensible things like maybe mandating the wearing of masks in public places, public transport. I think there could be some intelligent things done around making available the opportunity for old, sickly people to protect themselves. You know, the numbers are that are being thrown around in terms of how much money the government tends to raise to address the consequences of lockdown and the virus or anything to go by. You could spend a tiny fraction of those and do make an enormous difference for the poorer, old people who might be at risk, helping them to stay safe while the virus washes through the population. Many months, that takes a couple of months, you know, give it to them as an option. That kind of idea. We haven\\'t seen in our opinion nearly enough creative thinking around what could be done in that regard. Another thing we think that could be done reasonably cheaply would be to escalate the campaign for getting anti-retroviral medication to the unmanaged portion of the HIV positive community in the country, which numbers anywhere between 500,000 and 3 billion depending on who you speak to. You know, that\\'s a public health good any day of the week with all of that coronavirus, and that would take away one source of potential concern that those people are susceptible to dying from coronavirus. It\\'s not certain that they are, but no harm done in getting them onto HIV. So the range of things that could be done to lessen the impact to slow the rate of progression of the disease at much lower cost, you know, a tiny fraction of the cost being imposed on society by the lockdown. And so we think, yeah, we think that that\\'s the kind of thing that should be contemplated. It\\'s what\\'s unfolding before our eyes is a very economically destructive thing. I think it\\'s being underestimated by economists. There\\'s a lot of permanent damage being done in what we would call in economics world, institutional destruction, you know, businesses that are not going to be around after the lockdown. So probably what you\\'re asking for is closer to the Sweden model of what they did? Yes, and I think everybody needs to really look carefully at what\\'s going on there. I mean, over the last time, many days, the daily death count has been declining in Sweden, but for every two days, the garden or any other number of newspaper outlets have been writing these apocalyptic stories about how Sweden is going to go off the charts and everybody\\'s going to die and how awful it is. And that just simply hasn\\'t happened. The Swedish example suggests that that is possible. Now, of course, there are factors at playing Sweden that might be, not might might be at playing other countries. But I do think that people are making a rather too much of them. You know, this idea that the Swedes are unique among nations in terms of their natural level of social distancing and that kind of thing, I think, is a little bit overplayed. I mean, their children carried on going to school, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. And, just, Swedish are not little kids, not great social distances. They\\'re not great hand washes, you know. And I know I\\'ve got a couple of my own, you know. So they have, in my mind, taken the most mature and least panic approach to this whole thing and it\\'s going to serve them well in the long run and the economy will do a lot better than other countries that are under severe lockdowns. And it must be understood that our lockdown in South Africa is of the most restrictive in the world. It\\'s very hard to manage economy, manage an economy and, you know, centrally controlled and centrally planted. We\\'ve known that for, you know, many, many, many, many decades. And this is what we\\'re trying to do. We already know that that\\'s impossible. So I think these things have many unintended consequences and the economy is a networking. It\\'s not a silos. If you start knocking out nodes on the network, the networks failing, and that\\'s what\\'s happening. And I think the depth of the institutional failing and the depth of the cuts into the economy is being underestimated and it\\'s accelerating. Inside COVID-19, from Brazil. We\\'ve been tracking down Professor Ian Flock for quite a while and it\\'s good to have you with us, Professor, to talk about this incredible development at Tigerburg Hospital with robots and how the robots are now going to accelerate the treatment of COVID-19 patients. But for people who are coming for the first time to the medical world, what is the relationship between Stellenbosch University and the Tigerburg Hospital? Effectively, it\\'s a single platform where the University of Stellenbosch runs the training part or the education part of medical doctors, undergraduate and then specialist postgraduate, as well as the over- ancillary sciences. The physiotherapist\\'s OTs, his nursing, dietitics, et cetera. So it\\'s called a faculty of medicine and health sciences. And obviously, the practical component of that is Tigerburg Hospital. They join to each other and ultimately the training, the practical training that happens within Tigerburg itself. So, actually, you\\'re going away? Sorry, did you call it a teaching hospital? Yes, absolutely. So it\\'s called a tertiary level hospital. So we have all the, what they call, the very super specialized facilities. And then obviously, a public hospital for training and teaching. You\\'re a professor at Stellenbosch University, but you\\'re actually a neuroscientist who operates on spines. Yeah, well, yeah, so anything soft, you know, that conducts electricity. So basically, a neurosurgeon, so we do brain surgery, spinal cord surgery. So all of it, most of the neurosurgeons end up building themselves up in a certain part of neurosurgeons. So my specific interest is the spine and particularly the cervical spine, so the neck part. But within the collective, there\\'s the vascular surgeons, tumor surgeons, skull-based surgeons. So we all kind of have our niche, but at a facility like Tigerburg, where we\\'ve had so much pathology, we all effectively are jack-of-all-trades. So we do, you know, the basics of all the pathologies we see and then ultimately focusing on the very nasty stuff on our own super speciality. So COVID-19, sorry, so COVID-19, the getting to that, the robots or Quentin and Selma as you call them, how did you find out about them and what exactly are they going to be doing? So at the University of Stellenbosch, the Division of Neurosurgeon, we developed a skills lab about four years ago, 2016, called Sun Skill. And you\\'re welcome to have a look at it, Sun Skill. And this is a world-class training facility and inside we\\'ve got a quick one to be envious of. It\\'s really phenomenal, but what it does, it creates a platform for our registrars and our trainees to practice on surgical skill. You know, everything from suturing to endoscopic training to whatever you actually can dream of. We can actually simulate it in the lab and then ultimately translate those skills, improve them and translate them into the practical environment, which is a phenomenal way of teaching any surgical skill. And part of this Sun Skill is that we have this double robot. Now what it is, it provides us an opportunity to tap into the knowledge of our colleagues and world-class specialists that might be sitting in the US or the UK wherever. So we\\'ll dial into them, they\\'ll be there in a virtual presence and talk to our guys and give a lecture or actually just walk around the lab with the robot and give a bit of guidance. So it was initially, it still is a teaching tool. And then once the COVID crisis started hitting Professor Kunikur Humber, who runs the respiratory ICU. So he\\'s literally the guy standing in the front, the top of the pyramid and Kuni contacted me because his wife actually has done some practical stuff within the lab and said, \"Well, you know, she thinks that might be a great addition.\" And nobody could argue that. So immediately the following day we transported Quinton as they so fondly call him, which I think is a little bit of a play between Quinton Tarantino, I believe, or Quarantino, you know, whatever you choose to play. But for us, we were able to cross all the facilities and the wife everything was completely fine, so Quinton was deployed right away and immediately made an impact. We have spoken with ICU doctors on this program in the past and there\\'s great concern about the mortality rate for those who work in the ICUs, although clearly they\\'re hoping was the protective equipment that is now available to those who work in the past. And so we are available to doctors in South Africa that they can reduce those ratings. The expectation that we were given was that elsewhere in the world it\\'s as high as 20% because of repeated exposure to COVID-19. Using Quinton and perhaps also the other robot is that part of the thinking as well to try and get your frontline soldiers less exposed to this horrible virus. Absolutely, so part of the people, you know, if you think about the very sick patients are the ones that\\'s in ICU, ventilated or perhaps on high floor oxygen whichever way they are all managed by a team. It\\'s physiotherapist, nursing, the doctor, specialist, so it\\'s a whole team of people that needs to be present and it\\'s not like you just can put them into a space and then kind of think, you know, this is now what we\\'ve done. It\\'s a very dynamic situation in terms of ventilated settings and observations and how the body responds to certain interventions. So it demands a certain amount of presence. This is one thing we want to emphasize. So the robots don\\'t decrease the amount of human presence, but it increases the amount of visitations to the patients and to be able to relay not only if the patients, for example, not ventilated to relay the patients\\' own experience, but also look at ventilated things, observations, etc. and to interact with the patients. And then sort of a hybrid team between where the whole team perhaps does not have to be there. For example, I think it was two or three days ago, the team entered, but deliberately the registrar, the trainee, who actually admitted the patients throughout the night, stayed outside the unit, did not have to enter and could actually relay all the patients by virtue of the robot. So he was actually speaking to Professor Kuchemberg and his team at the bedside, but it actually decreased the exposure of the doctor. So ultimately, the amount of contact to the really risky environment is decreased. And also for some ad hoc situation, you need to pop in there really quick. You know, sign on, control it and get there and sort it. Intensivists have told us that the colleagues over the age of 60 are being kept away from COVID-19 patients because of the risk. Would they in your environment, because clearly there\\'s quite a lot of experience and skills there, would they be able to use this robot in any way to make a contribution? Absolutely. This is also one of the options that it really provides, is that let\\'s say Kooni, for example, for Zil, or any of the major decision-making. You\\'ve got to understand the dynamic. Everybody\\'s got an exceptionally crucial role within the team, but ultimately when it comes to the final tweaks and stuff, certain things happen at a level. And let\\'s say Kooni for Zil, he can actually set it up if he\\'s quarantined or if he\\'s not completely incapacitated. He can actually manage the robot from there. So, he\\'s presence is not lost. And again, you know, the same for if there\\'s a second person to sign in. So, ultimately, that presence is in. And like you said, if there\\'s a high risk group of people that needs to be part of the decision-making, but don\\'t have to be there, this gives them the option to actually be there in a virtual presence. What does Kooni look like? Well, he\\'s actually, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever seen a segue scooter, you know, there\\'s all the scooters. Now, this is almost like a mini segue. It\\'s really tiny. It\\'s about, I\\'d say, about 20, 30 centimeters in width. And it\\'s essentially like a pole and then it\\'s like iPad on a segue. So, he\\'s got quite a thin profile. Doesn\\'t take up a lot of space. He can turn on a nickel and he ultimately docks in a little docking station. So, he\\'s always ready to go. And that\\'s him. He can become higher or lower, you know, depending on how fast he wants to move. So, he\\'s literally at about aye-hite and he stands there right next to you. And it\\'s like iPad on wheels. Can you talk to the patient? Yes. So, it\\'s like a Skype interview. It\\'s like a doctor or it is using a quentine. He\\'s actually faces on the screen and he\\'s actually, and he\\'s in control. So, he can turn around and talk to him. He needs to talk to the little camera module at the top is dynamic. So, that actually can zoom in or turn around. So, he\\'s got a sort of an optic range that he can work with. And again, the controls are fairly simple. It\\'s like up, down, left and right. So, you rotate and you move forward and backwards. And quite sensitive. And self-writing, so it means if somebody with a knock-hit or if he drives into a bed, for example, he doesn\\'t fall over. So, it\\'s very clever tech. Professor Flock, is anyone else using Quinton Lookalax elsewhere in the world or elsewhere in South Africa? If you look at, I think that the Tilly presence for one is usually a static type of entity. But there are products like this available. A couple of makers, I think this is called, this is probably from what we call double robotics. And they\\'re highly rated in the world. There are a couple of other ones, but I haven\\'t seen any in South Africa. I do believe there\\'s an engineering company who is busy designing a solution for local. I want to say low cost. I want to say local South African cost product. Hopefully, to actually do this, to actually give people the option to sign in and decrease their own risk where they needed in high risk environments. On unit, we\\'ve got an insulated unit. And the moment you start dealing with patients that\\'s unknown, there\\'s a fear factor amongst everybody. And again, probably sometimes unfounded, but that\\'s the reality of everything that\\'s been going on around us. To be able to substitute yourself, whichever part of that group of management team you are, is a wonderful privilege. How are you guys feeling at Tigerburg Hospital about COVID-19 and the tidal wave that we told is coming? Ultimately, everything is, we adapt. There\\'s this fear of what\\'s coming, then it arrives, and then you start just dealing with it. So, yes, we are slowly seeing the numbers increasing. I think the Western Cape had a good chat to the head of occupational health yesterday. And we have a very good testing principle, contact tracing. So, the testing is done very, very thoroughly at least in our environment to understand. And that leads to a lot of numbers. So, we are picking up the positive patients. This is an unavoidable condition. It\\'s beyond any restriction. So, it can\\'t be contained. So, we have to deal with it. And I think at the moment, we\\'ve reached that level where my feedback that I get from the stats cards is that it\\'s kind of like a consistent volume at this point in time. We constantly have patients in ICU, the wards are, or the COVID wards are fairly saturated, but there is a dynamic within them. Patients are getting better. We are getting better at treating them as well. We have learned a few things. And I think that\\'s a good place to be in, where people are getting used to being careful, if you call it that. And ultimately, that kind of settles the nerves a bit. I think if there\\'s a double wave of what we currently see, I think there\\'s the next set of uncertainty. But for now, the wheels are turning and we\\'re managing to contain it and at least manage patients. Everybody has now figured out their role. There\\'s special pathways going to COVID-theat and there\\'s special radiology pathways, etc. And the reality is TB didn\\'t go big. It\\'s still around. And trauma is, whether it\\'s a lack of alcohol or a scalable alcohol, I don\\'t know, but alcohol seems to be. Lockdown has decreased our trauma significantly, but now it\\'s creeping up again. So the standard workload still is upon us. We have to manage that within the COVID crisis. From a neurosurgical point of view, people that come into our unit are typically very ill and need quite urgent intervention. If you could go back six weeks when the lockdown was brought into South Africa, had that not occurred? Had we done the Swedish route, for instance? How would our medical practitioners have coped? I think the Swedish model, the herd immunity model and everything has become quite topical. Because most people are saturated. They are now done with it. People are now actually in a lot of trouble, and I don\\'t dare express my opinion there too much. But outside of this, our country is not like Sweden where there can be an announcement and everybody will wear masks and everybody will perform social distancing. I think I was just not a first world country, whether that\\'s, I think, makes you more compliant, I don\\'t know. But in Sweden, it\\'s easy to decrease something and be followed. At the same time, if you\\'ve got 3,000 fatalities already, it depends on how you look at the percentage. If it\\'s per million, yes, they are on par with a lot of other countries. If it\\'s per test, they\\'re not doing very well. But ultimately, they have achieved, or they look like they\\'re going to achieve, what we ultimately also are aiming for. You can ask me, what did we learn or what did we benefit out of the lockdown? Firstly, it\\'s getting systems in place. If there was going to be a flood of patients amidst the singularity that is our usual work, that is an entity that is just an epidemic bigger than anything else, the trauma and the extreme pathologies. We would have thanked, at least in the public service, it would have been too much. Right now, we\\'ve managed to contain it and we\\'ve managed to do that. I think our lockdown\\'s biggest benefit was education. I think people are wearing their masks, they are performing social distancing. And look, you can\\'t uniformly apply that. There\\'s skeptics, there\\'s people who always believe they can buy themselves out of problems. Water restriction, I can have a borole, power cuts, I can have an inverter. There\\'s always a solution, there\\'s no solution, you\\'ve got to follow the rules. I think it is effectively a very nasty flu or influenza where people also die from. But in this case, there are very clear high-risk patients. So the way forward, isolate those people, high-risk patients, older people make very sure that they\\'re not exposed. And for the rest of us, I would be an advocate of fairly rapidly introducing businesses as usual. With masks and social distancing and ultimately create that Swedish model, but now it\\'s in our terms. And on the hand side, I don\\'t know, if we didn\\'t do it, I think we\\'ve been in disaster. We are getting into disaster as well, not from COVID, but from many other things. But I don\\'t think there was a wind wind in this hand of cards. It was always going to be trouble. But as a scientist looking back on it, you\\'ve had the opportunity to prepare. Can we get any better prepared than we are always? I don\\'t think so. I\\'m a college in private facilities of all gutties, there are things going on. In the public service, we are as jacked up as we can be. We\\'ve got the high turnover, we\\'re managing it now. I say, \"Look, I\\'m only speaking from our facility at least.\" But as ready as we can be, and if we\\'re going to get flooded, the people who suffer from the flooding is the people who have the non-neer-fital conditions. Not the vital conditions. We can only see that impact in time. But as it stands for now, we are coping. And I think also in a neurosurgical perspective, we are operating in slates. I\\'ve been cut down, but still to an extent where we can manage all our emergency services. Our emergency services are still functioning very well. And now we\\'re also learning. We\\'re looking at the numbers. We\\'re seeing things picking up, looking at a peak in June/July now, they would suggest. So we\\'re all kind of taking it day by day. But the system is still functioning amidst the lockdown. One of the scary things, and I must say this, is you\\'ve found out that people, the perspective, I think we\\'ve gained that now here, having dealt with it. We\\'ve been exposed. We\\'re now dealing with patients. And as I mentioned, the anxiety level has dropped a bit and we\\'re getting better. But I believe that people who are in companies are just opening up. They\\'re screening forms every morning. But three days in a row, there was a case of somebody coughing and having a headache. So they\\'re screening, but there\\'s no action. So people are not jacked up to as to how to implement that. And I think there\\'s gradual release from that, hopefully we\\'ll implement these type of screenings and get everybody to the level of a sort of a less anxious state and just get on with things. And ultimately, it\\'s inevitable, but now it\\'s on our terms, I believe. Have you got enough protection as medical practitioners? I think so. So all our SOPs are in place. There\\'s face shields, masks. There\\'s no in 95 masks. But it\\'s all about if you have a mask near social distancing, your chances of getting this is extremely low. And if you had a child that\\'s got the fruit, you\\'re not going to take into Grandma anyway back in the day. So I said back in the day, which was six weeks ago, seven years ago. But you wouldn\\'t do that anyway. So a common sense to apply. And I think people are kind of seeing this as an Ebola in a way. One touch and it\\'s over. And that\\'s not the case. You hear about the massive entities being shut down because somebody seven days ago was this positive. Now sure, that is an issue and you\\'ve got to be vigilant. But after seven days, there\\'s been self-monitoring. There\\'s been people who might have gotten it, would have gotten it by now. So a certain amount of common sense needs to apply. And again, I might be taking a bit of a less rigid opinion on this thing. But we\\'ve reached the point, like I said, we\\'ve dealt with it now. The anxiety is a little bit less. And we actually have to move forward. We have to go on. Inside COVID-19 from Brazil. As we slowly return back to work, there\\'s a sense among office workers set to large open offices. And chatting around the coffee machine or in the kitchen appear to be over. Employees will be forced to make considerable changes to enable workers to return back to work safely. And some of these changes will remain when the pandemic ends. Bloomberg\\'s Conrad Putsia looks at some of the measures that companies are considering and whether measures related to age could be discriminating. I think the big thing that everyone\\'s realized is that the office, as we know it, is over. There\\'s not going to be any going back to the big open floor office the way we knew it before. And companies right now, while most people are working from home, are already working on all these changes to the office. So they\\'re doing a bunch of different things. One of the more basic things that they\\'re doing is they\\'re moving desks further apart. They\\'re putting up little plexiglass dividers, for example, between desks so that if you sneeze, you don\\'t sneeze on your coworker. They\\'re doing things like they\\'re cleaning offices more, which maybe some offices already did when people were still there. So those are the basic things. What we\\'ve noticed, what is actually really interesting, is that a lot of employers are deciding they need to do a lot more to really keep their workers safe when they get back to the office. And they\\'re doing things that really would have been unthinkable to a lot of people just a couple of weeks ago, even, for example, a lot of companies are installing thermal cameras in the lobbies of buildings so that if you walk into your office and you have a fever, the camera will notice this. And maybe there\\'s going to be someone at the door who stops you and says, \"Hey, don\\'t come in. You have a fever.\" Companies are now installing apps on their employees\\' smartphones that basically track how good you are at social distancing and who you come into contact with. There are all these sensors and cameras and buildings that keep track of occupancy. If the room gets too crowded, the employer will know and they\\'ll know who is in that room and who to blame. So, there\\'s all this essentially surveillance technology that\\'s being added to the office in the name of safety. The people that we\\'ve talked about have very mixed feelings about this. I think everyone recognizes that we have to do pretty dramatic things so that people can go back to the office and still be safe. But at the same time, there are concerns. And there\\'s a couple that we keep hearing about. One huge concern is that all this surveillance tech that\\'s being installed may remain in the office permanently, even when the pandemic is over. So, maybe over the next six months, over the next year, that thermal camera is being used to take your temperature and these sensors are being used to make sure you don\\'t come into contact with someone who was infected. But what happens when the pandemic is over? Are these sensors still going to trace your movements? Is that going to violate your privacy? So, that\\'s one huge concern. The second concern that we hear about is the potential for discrimination. So, one of the things that employers are doing is they\\'re considering dividing their workforce into groups based on how at risk they are to the virus. So, Interpublic, which is a huge advertising company, they are considering dividing their workforce into three groups. So, level one would be you\\'re young and healthy and you have antibodies against the virus. So, you\\'re basically safe. Level two would be you\\'re young and healthy, but you don\\'t have antibodies, but you\\'re probably going to be fine. If you get the virus. Level three is maybe you\\'re old, you have pre-existing conditions or you\\'re a smoker, so you\\'re level three. And they basically want to group the workforce into these levels to then decide who can come back to the office at what time. And there\\'s obviously a logic behind that, right? You want to make sure that only those people who can actually really be safe in the office go back. But the risk is that people are being discriminated against. You know, if you\\'re at risk, you can\\'t go back to the office that\\'s maybe in your interest because it keeps you safe. But maybe it has a disadvantage for you if you can\\'t go to meetings, if people don\\'t see you in the office. Is that going to be harmful to your career? And I think those are some of the issues that we\\'ll be grappling with for months to come. Inside COVID-19, members use. The list of big names in business in San Africa that are struggling to keep their doors open is growing. It includes ETCOM, the owners of ETCOM and JAT that has voluntary placed itself under business rescue. COM Air, SA Express and Associated magazines that has closed its doors. A survey by Statistics South Africa revealed that 42% of the country\\'s businesses are struggling and that they have run out of financial resources to continue operating during the COVID-19 lockdown. P.J. Felthason, a Cape Town lawyer from Gillen and Felthason, who specializes in business rescue and direct-asliability, says companies in financial distress should not remain in lockdown paralysis. It\\'s time for businesses to honestly assess their position and to consider options. It told business that the moratorium, granted by the companies and intellectual property commission during the lockdown period, does not apply to third parties, which leaves any business under stress and their directors wide open. I\\'ve found that many companies at the moment are using hope as a strategy. Unfortunately, boards of directors have got a duty to operate in the best interests of their companies and all of the stakeholders. So what they need to be doing is considering where they find themselves financially at the moment. And if they find themselves in financial distress, which has a definition in the Companies Act, which really means that if they aren\\'t able to pay all of their debts as they\\'re called due and payable in the next six months, or there\\'s a likelihood that they may go insolvent in the next six months, they have to make a decision. They have to decide, are we going to be able to trade out of this? If we are, then we need to decide, are we going to do this through the mechanism of business rescue? If we\\'re not going to use business rescue, then if we find ourselves in financial distress, we actually have to contact all of our creditors and all the other stakeholders known as affected persons and tell them how we intend to do this. Now, that has a double-edged sword because you tell your suppliers that you\\'re in financial distress. It\\'s unlikely that they\\'re going to continue to supply you. But if you don\\'t do that and you don\\'t go into business rescue or you don\\'t decide to go to full open, going to liquidation or an offer of compromise to your creditors, you can find yourself in breach of your fiduciary duties as directors. And a lot of people have misunderstood the communication from the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission, where they sent out a circular saying that they won\\'t be performing their duties in terms of 22 of the Companies Act, which is effectively where they investigate companies which are trading in insolvent circumstances, et cetera. To mean that directors simply don\\'t have to apply their fiduciary duties in respect of trading in financial distress circumstances. And that\\'s simply not the case. Boards need to be looking at their businesses, looking at the future and saying, \"Can we trade out of this or can we not?\" If they find themselves in financial distress, they need to be taking specialist legal advice and financial advice to say, \"What are we going to do not?\" They can\\'t simply sit on their hands. Didn\\'t the CIPC say that there was a 60-day window before they needed to do that? Yes, but what they were saying is, \"Look, we are not going to perform our services as mandated in terms of the Companies Act to investigate these matters.\" But that is simply a matter of, I think, of the CRPC\\'s resources not being available. It\\'s not that you are somehow forgiven from your duties in the Companies Act not to trade recklessly, not to trade in insolvent circumstances and not to trade with an intent to defraud your creditors. Have you found that more and more companies are coming to you and asking for advice saying, \"Listen, we are in trouble. Have you got any idea of the figures of what the level of distress out there is?\" Look, only anecdotally do I have any idea of figures, but my phone goes all day, all night, and it\\'s -- what is the position with regards to financial distress, business, race, and liquidation, and what do I do about my landlord? Those are the two questions that I get asked over and over and over every day, seven days a week. I\\'ve seen figures from internationally, like places like the UK. They think a fifth of small businesses could go bust because of this. Is it small businesses, medium, or large businesses that are in trouble at the moment? I think it\\'s everybody. You know, if you look historically, you\\'ve got a great business. It was going on swimmingly, declaring dividends, et cetera. But now you have nakas. It doesn\\'t matter how well you live in the spot. Unless you\\'ve ordered up some financial reserves, and there is no hard and fast rule as to who the supplies do. I think it\\'s everybody. Do you have any idea which sector would be most affected by this? Because if you look at tourism, I mean, nothing is going on there at the moment. I think that tourism and hospitality definitely, I think that the head races anywhere where there\\'s close physical contact like that in the cosmetics industry, I think that they are definitely seeing the dance out of this, and I think that they will probably be less affected than anybody else because you can\\'t cut somebody\\'s hair remotely. You know, the restaurants are able to serve takeaways and deliver food, but that\\'s not nearly what they need to be able to survive. I mean, they didn\\'t start out as takeaways. Those, they started out as certain restaurants. You know, they\\'re not allowed to sell alcohol, which has of course been one of the big money spinners for restaurants. I really think that when people find themselves in the stress, they sit on their hands. The disputes that are going to follow this, I think people should rather than finding their way into a court when the courts reopen, because of course, you know that the courts are all but closed at the moment back for extremely urgent and COVID-related matters. People should really be considering mediation as an alternative to approaching the courts and utilizing litigation. There are so many well trained commercial mediators out there to be able to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently. They can do it remotely. You know, I was involved in one on Zoom the other day. It was a very, very big dispute involving millions and millions of round, tens of millions of round, and it was resolved in two days. And I really think that the companies in disputes with each other, especially landlords and tenants, should be considering this as an alternative. Well, people perhaps waiting for the help from the government. Did they possibly think that the measures announced by the government would help them? But I don\\'t think that any measures announced by the government are going to help you in a dispute with your landlord or in a dispute with your supplier. All that\\'s happening at the moment is the debt chairs have been shifted around the Titanic, because if you\\'re not paying your rental now, when the courts reopen, you\\'re going to have an unsympathetic landlord who\\'s going to take action against you. And you might find that, you know, there\\'s a lot of noise around force, measure, supervening, impossibilities of performance, all kinds of things like that. But do you really want to test that in a court some months down the line? You might find that it goes against you, either way as a landlord or a tenant. It\\'s much better to come to a mediated commercial solution now. So we\\'ve prepared sort of templates, solvency and liquidity, Excel tests that you can basically punch your numbers in and say, okay, well, what does it look like? And then we\\'re preparing like a decision tree for directors. What do you do now? And all of these things are being conducted via Zoom and by Microsoft teams. So companies don\\'t have an excuse to say that they don\\'t have access to the specialist to be able to advise them. Every down on Zoom calls with clients saying, okay, well, what are we going to do? What\\'s the strategy? And if you don\\'t employ that, I promise you what will happen down the line at the wound licking ceremony is people are going to go into liquidation. And after the liquidation, they\\'re going to be insolvency inquiries and creditors are going to say, now, board of directors, you knew this. Why didn\\'t you take action? And there\\'s a very real possibility then that boards of directors can be ordered to pay the debts of the company personally. In terms of section 424 of our 1973 Companies Act, which is applicable to liquidations. But if a board has been trading recklessly, the board of directors and anybody, it\\'s not just directors, anybody who was managing the trade and affairs of the company. So even if you\\'re not called a director, but you\\'re like a shadow director, you call them in England, you can be you can be ordered to pay the debts of the company.

      "{'transcript': \" Thanks to our patrons Carl Jackson Kelsey Terrell Richard Goode Daniel Ammons Sarah Rogers Jim Collison Joni Ferguson Kavanaugh Christine Gerber Jay Hannah and Lori Schwartz The North Omaha history podcast is a volunteer effort But you can help us meet expenses by becoming a patron for as little as a dollar a month Go to patreon.com/omaha Welcome to the north Omaha history podcast with noted author and historian Adam Fletcher Sassy Each week Adam takes you on a guided tour through Omaha's dynamic past North Omaha's screaming cold history and the new 24th and lake historic district is a tremendous example of how that's so after its first developments in the 1870s this intersection evolved to become a hotbed of the African American community as well as the heart of the Jewish community a farm supply area and a lot more in 2016 38 buildings were included on the new listing of the national register of historic places while that's pretty cool Adam this this area is just full of stories isn't it? It certainly is Steve when we begin to appeal this we're going to hear a lot of different layers I've actually for this podcast I've identified five layers of history for the intersection of 24th and Lake I'm going to talk about the region right around it maybe you know four blocks north and four blocks south and four blocks east and four blocks west but keep in mind that 24th and Lake has been the center stone of many communities over the years and I'm going to talk about those as well it's a very important intersection to say the least recognized of course by the federal government through that national register of historic places but also always known to be that way by different ethnic and racial groups in Omaha let's dig into it a little bit it goes all the way back you've mentioned 1870 right around that time period the road that we know today is north 24th street was called Saunders Road and Saunders Road was named after the last territorial governor in Nebraska a man named Alvin Saunders. Alvin Saunders had a mansion over on north 16th street but they named Saunders Road after him in his honor well he was still alive by the way Saunders Road led straight from the capital square where we know central high school is today and went way north it went past the brand new Creighton University that opened up in the 1870s it came through the intersection with 24th and coming coming street named after another one of the territorial governors and then it came north and as it came north from coming street on that whole street what was called Saunders Street was beginning to get packed full of businesses Jewish people were some of the very first settlers along north 24th street they developed a community where we know where we think of the near north side today this community that's south and east of 24th and lake this community was a Jewish community originally not only Jews but largely focused on Jewish people there were Jewish synagogues and shoals there and there were all kinds of different neighborhoods there were actually the good side of the neighborhood and the bad side of the neighborhood those Jewish folks they were developing businesses and culture and all kinds of things of their own when Jews showed up in Omaha they were literally push cart salesman there were stories of them literally pushing carts through the neighborhoods with fruits and vegetables for sale or pots and pans silverware and all kinds of different things out of carts there were also junk collectors there were store owners and eventually all these folks needed places to have their business because those pots didn't only sell out of carts they eventually sold out of storefronts and those cleaners they needed places to have their operations and on and on the Jews in north Omaha ended up building up north 24th street originally between the 1870s and the turn of the century in 1900 Jewish people built at least three or four hundred buildings along north 24th street from Dodge Street all the way north as far as we know development today and that even a little bit further still it's pretty incredible but a lot of those early buildings Steve they were built a wood they were pioneer storefronts so if you can imagine the old west if you're if our listeners are listening right now and they imagine the old west you get this image of the wooden storefront with the false front and you know the the storekeeper standing out front with his sweep and he's pushing dirt back and forth that's what north 24th street looked like originally when it was called Saunders Road there were wagons everywhere horses up and down the way kids running along the wooden sidewalks you can envision the sound of the you know the wind blowing through the intersection at that point that region all around 24th and lake was an open prairie that was just getting busted and developed houses were first getting built in the 1870s and 80s around 24th and lake the region grew up quick and the houses they took their time to fill in but eventually they did fill in to the north of 24th and lake there were country mansions that belonged to rich old industrialists and capitalists who had offices in downtown Omaha these guys wanted to live out in the woods out in the country and so guys like Thomas Maine who was a real estate man in downtown Omaha he was a contemporary with George Francis train and other real estate moguls in Omaha Maine built a gigantic mansion out of a farmhouse that was originally at 24th and Pratt that was way north of 24th and lake but the point is that Maine had to go up Saunders Road every day to get to his mansion his next door neighbor and another mansion was a guy named JJ Brown JJ Brown built a big Italian eight mansion and he went up Saunders Road every day from downtown Omaha and there were other mansions along the way oh by the way Steve that mentioned that Maine built M-A-Y-N-E that mansion ended up becoming the retic mansion owned by John I-Rettick a lawyer in downtown Omaha Rettick handed off to his son Oak Rettick and Oak ended up selling it to become the University of Omaha that's right all the students from the University Omaha eventually had to go up north 24th Street through the intersection of 24th and Lake 24th and Lake was happened by the 18 80s and early 90s it was a farm intersection and you had all these farms that were between Lake Street and Florence all the way up there there were cornfields all over the place Maine had a 10 acre orchard 24th and Pratt if you can believe that but there were cornfields all along the ways there were all different kinds of sizes everybody in the neighborhood owned a cow this is an era when the cows and the cow milk wasn't sold out of stores it was from your cow that you had in the backyard they often had pigs and they usually had a donkey or a horse some kind of a work animal to help them do their work on their little acreages the acreages were from one acre all the way up to 20 and 50 acres and they were owned all around that north Omaha region again from Lake Street all the way north up to Ames and and further on even so you had all kinds of development you had all kinds of things going on around 24th and Lake in that first early era that Saunders Road again the horse road it was a pretty hop in place there were farm goods stores and a grocery store which wasn't even really a grocery store at that point it was a pioneer store and these general stores we'll think of them as especially out in the west at that point these general stores got all their goods from the jobbers Canyon downtown and they bring them up and sell them right at this intersection for the convenience of the people who lived around there there are also churches that were establishing getting along the way the Saunders Road was really important as one of the major roots up to two towns that were to the north one town was called Saratoga Saratoga was at 24th and Ames and we've talked about that in the past podcast Saratoga was kind of a live and die town it started in the 1850s and pretty soon it's the company that ran it shut it down but the town kept growing and there was a school there in the church and other things that helped it maintain and eventually it was sucked up by Omaha as the population went north there but Saratoga was an important place for Saunders Road to lead to the other place that Saunders Road took you up to Saunders Road went all the way north to where we know the 24th and 4th is today and then went all the way north to where Florence Boulevard intersects with 24th Street that's right at one point Florence Boulevard stopped and it turned west to go into Miller Park and that extension right there is still to this day called Florence Boulevard Florence Boulevard has an interesting spur as it were and there was a road through Miller Park that connected over to what we know today is north 30th Street because north 30th Street didn't exist as a major throughfare instead the road to Florence went along Florence Boulevard from downtown Omaha all the way up to Miller Park cut across Miller Park and then went up north 30th Street and that was the road to Florence you can take Saunders Road that went through 24th and Lake up to 24th and 4th up to the intersection right there with Florence Boulevard and turn left and go through Miller Park up to north 30th and then into Florence so Saunders Road was a connector between downtown Omaha 24th and Lake that we know today 24th and Fort which developed quickly 24th and Ames which was Saratoga and then it connected up to Florence so a really important street that did a lot of important things there were by the 1890s there were businesses there were houses there were the beginning of apartments and there were churches that lined the entirety of Saunders Road but especially around 24th and Lake in 1890 it began to change a little bit more ambitious businesses were coming in all three corners at 24th and Lake had at least two story buildings by 1890 in 1898 of course there was a massive beautiful humongous important event that took place that affected 24th and Lake a lot by this point the street had gone from being called Saunders Road to being called 24th Street because it was literally the 24th street from the first street next to the Missouri River the 24th street as it went north did all those connections from Dodd Street to coming to Lake and as it did that it was filling in and had all these different things beginning to appear around 24th and Lake were things like Vodville theaters Vodville theaters were coming in where there was one built that was called the Diamond Theater the Diamond Theater eventually became a movie house there were other events that happened other things that grew up the first brick building was built on the northeast corner of 24th and Lake in 1894 and that building was pretty important it had some important businesses in it there was a farm implement store that moved into the southeast corner of 24th and Lake in the 1890s that eventually was called Lion Products Farm Implement store and we're going to hear about that later on as we go along and yeah the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898 happened just north of 24th and Lake didn't extend down to Lake but it was still an important intersection because you literally had 2.9 million visitors all summer long in 1898 coming through the intersection of 24th and Lake so you can picture all of those crowds and all of those people taking streetcars that went north and south along 24th Street streetcars that went east and west along Lake Street and they were heading up to the Trans-Mississippi Exposition now one of the important implements that went into this intersection actually over at 26th and Lake emerged first in the 1870s it was a horse paddock Steve that doesn't sound too romantic but you can picture a barn not not a big round barn but a square bulky barn like a I don't know one story building with a flat roof and this barn had dozens of horses and this gigantic paddock where the horses were allowed to roam and you know there's feeding area there was a blacksmith shop there was also a trolley shop right there that's right 26th and Lake on the northwest corner of that intersection was the site of the Omaha Horse Railway streetcar barn in the 1870s that started in 1873 it consolidated and changed and grew as the technologies around it grew the streetcar barn eventually transformed from horse drawn to being trolleys that were run on electric wires all over there were electric streetcars that ran on their own current there were lots of different innovations that came out of that place but for the next between the 1870s and 1950s streetcars galore traveling through 24th and Lake because they were heading over to the barn right there at 26th and Lake as a side note will say that the city of Omaha just demolished the gigantic streetcar barn that was there just two years ago they wrecked it it was part of the historic district and everything they just smashed it down with no regard they have put up a little monument to the streetcar barn right there on the corner is kind of a marker but they did lose the integrity and beauty of that corner by demolishing that streetcar barn regardless 24th and Lake strove one of the great developments at 24th and Lake was a business on the southwest corner that was called Chrissy drugs Chrissy drugs CRISSEY Chrissy was Omaha's perhaps first female pharmacist she opened up her store right there at 24th and Lake after her husband died young and she stayed on that corner for several years after but almost 20 years actually but she built up a two-story building on the southwest corner originally then in 1913 the 24th and Lake intersection was targeted for demolition bump-up bomb that's right Steve Demolition the tornado the great 1913 Easter Sunday tornado came through on March 23rd 1913 and it weighed laced the great 1913 Easter Sunday tornado came through the intersection on March 23rd of that year and it laid waste to the entire intersection of 24th and Lake dozens of buildings were obliterated and more than a hundred people died around the intersection to the north to the south but even where the intersection was on the northwest corner one building over from the corner was the diamond movie theater motion picture theater and the diamond theater was hit obliterated by the tornado there was a pool hall in the southeast corner there was a couple buildings down the pool hall was called the idle wild pool hall and the idle wild pool hall was hammered by the tornado there were bodies strewn everywhere and buildings falling apart day by day the tornado came through on a Sunday and it targeted people right after church had released so some people were still in the streets dressed in their finest it was horror it was painful it was hard to see but even harder to go through I'm sure we can look through photos today from the Durham Museum archive and other sources that show the obliteration of the 24th and Lake intersection in my article at northomahahistory.com I share a bunch of the pictures and Steve it's hard to see I have an article specifically about the Easter Sunday tornado and I put more than 30 pictures in there just to really show the extent of the damage but also you can see the humanity you can see the way that people are feeling they're walking around in their Sunday best right after a tornado smacked their neighborhood as hard as it could three story buildings torn to ashes brick facades thrown blocks and blocks away bodies obvious in the photos it's terrible to look at and yet it provides a necessary testament to remind us of how severe and how serious tornadoes are were back then but continue to be today one of the buildings that shows up in those photos was the ob funeral home just to the east of 24th and Lake the building actually still stands today it's a house a regular four square american four square house that doesn't look too pretentious on the outside but this photo from 1913 shows a crowd of African-americans a crowd of hundreds who are filing in to attend a funeral there's coffin stacked in the yard next to it and there's signs of obliteration all around this building to the east of the intersection of 24th and Lake there's also the Webster telephone exchange building we've known it as the Great Plains hit black history museum for a long time it served as that but in 1913 it was an active telephone exchange however they needed it for other purposes they cleared out a lot of the desks and they made a lot of space and they used the Webster telephone exchange building after the Easter Sunday tornado of 1913 they used it as a temporary morgue for the hundreds of bodies that were in the neighborhood there were other funeral homes there were legitimate funeral homes all around 24th and Lake they were started by Jewish people who needed their own funeral homes because European omohans didn't like Jews and didn't want them in their funeral homes with them Jews also have specific customs around burial and and the process of embalming etc so they had their own funeral homes African-americans had to have their own funeral homes they were situated around 24th and Lake because of the black population in that area was growing by 1913 there were more than 5,000 African-americans living in the near north side no mohann they worked in places like this packing houses in south Omaha they worked at the UP yards but they were also porters on the trains heading in and out of Omaha with all these different companies there was actually a neighborhood just to the south and east of 24th and Lake that was called Porter's Row because all of these upper low-income African-american gentlemen with means wanted to live by each other they knew each other they trusted each other and they had a block of houses just for them and their families Porter's Row 24th and Lake was still vibrant even after that tornado and Steve their goal the business owners the neighborhoods the city of Omaha's goal after the tornado was to show its resilience and might and to recover from that tornado as quickly as possible and the pictures show it within a month there was almost no sign of that tornado ever having happened in and around 24th and Lake houses were repaired buildings were rebuilt today out of the four corners of buildings that used to exist at 24th and Lake only one of them still stands but that building was built in 1913 right after the Easter Sunday tornado today it's the home of the Union for Contemporary Arts but back then it was the home of the Lion Farm Implement store that's right those farmers are still coming from the 1880s all the way into the 1910s they were coming to Lion but we're not done with that business it'll be back soon other businesses that were right there that had started to pop up after and during and after the Trans-Mississippi Exposition of 1898 in addition to Chrissy's pharmacy there were also nightclubs there were bars and saloons there were restaurants appearing and all kinds of different things that were coming around cleaners were becoming important at that corner because there were people who had jobs that needed clean clothes constantly and yeah there was lots of development that was happening grocery stores had started coming in on the northwest corner of 24th and Lake today there's a park a Martin Luther King Memorial site where a gigantic three-story building once stood this three-story building was home to a grocery store starting in the 1890s that continued all the way into the 1960s so long-time grocery store on the northwest corner but in the two floors above it there were professional offices where African-American lawyers dentists and doctors had their offices from the 1890s all the way into the 1960s and even the 70s before the building was demolished on the top floor of the Union for Contemporary Arts there were also doctors offices as well as a hotel at one point and apartments later on so 24th and Lake continued this vibrancy going all the way through 1919 and that year one of the most horrendous events if not the most horrendous event in Omaha history happened it didn't happen at 24th and Lake but the effects of the event happened and they affected that corner for the next well maybe even still today Steve a hundred years later it was September of 1919 when a mob of 20,000 people raided the Douglas County Courthouse in downtown Omaha and dragged out a man named Wilbroughn Wilbroughn was a worker who suffered rheumatoid arthritis who was accused of raping a white girl this mob decided that he was guilty and they were determined to lynch him Steve they dragged him out in lynching right there in front of the courthouse we have a great podcast about that that shares a lot of the details and I don't want to over broadcast them right here but the important part for our intersection of 24th and Lake is that that mob was bloodthirsty they were going after African Americans and instead of just stopping with lynching will Brown they turned north the bloody event took place overnight they destroyed a lot of buildings downtown they nearly destroyed the brand new Douglas County Courthouse and then they turned north with the intention of heading to 24th and Lake to quote teach African Americans a lesson they didn't get there because along the way after midnight when they started before the next morning at 6 a.m. US Army troops showed up at the intersection of 24th and Lake US Army troops showed up and they showed up at the intersection of 24th and coming they showed up at the intersection of 16th and coming they went up and also showed up at the corner of 16th and Lake they went over to 30th Street they covered Lake coming and they protected the Black neighborhood now in that same neighborhood Steve we had African Americans we had Jewish people but there were also Scandinavian immigrants who lived and worked all throughout that region there were European Americans who lived and worked all throughout that region there were a lot of white immigrant churches from Germany and England and the Scandinavians all throughout the neighborhood right around 24th and Lake places like the Swedish Lutheran Church and the English congregational church and on and on and on Methodists and Lutherans and Presbyterians and all kinds of folks had churches right around 24th and Lake and when these hordes came north to attack the neighborhood they were going to attack them all blindly they were looking for African Americans walking in the street they were looking for blacks to attack their houses black people that night of the riot got firearms from the businesses at 24th and Lake and they went to their rooftops to protect their house to protect their families and to shoot the white mob as it came but the US Army intervened kept the mob out but picture that Steve right at the intersection of 24th and Lake they set up Gatlin guns that's right gigantic guns on wagon wheels with huge rounds of bullets and they were ready to spray down those protesters right at 24th and Lake the US Army occupied that intersection for more than a week and kept North Omaha on virtual martial law it wasn't declared formally but everybody knew you had a curfew you had hidden you had prohibited travel and you weren't going to get away with it if you tried anything they kept the neighborhood safe but the other thing that they did the US Army by implementing that quote safety zone for blacks they created redlining in North Omaha as we know it today redlining is the phenomenon where African Americans are forced to live within a certain district because of economic social cultural other circumstances in North Omaha's case African Americans were put through redlining starting in 1919 with the lynching of Will Brown when the US Army intervened on their behalf to quote keep them safe but in turn by saying if you stay within this line we'll keep you safe they establish the redlined area now that came back around later on in the 1930s when the US federal government's homeowner loaner loaning corporation used those same lines to establish lending and insurance patterns for that affected African Americans to this day but regardless 24th and Lake Gatlin guns 1919 and then the intersection changed again so we go from this pioneer area with Sun or pioneer era with Saunders Road we build up the commerce all the way through to 1919 and then in 1919 the segregation begins white people fled from the region right right around 24th and Lake all the way down to coming they fled they sold their houses as fast as they could they got out of there and I'm talking about everybody not all at once it took a few decades to actually empty North Omaha out of that region south between Lake and coming to mostly empty it out of white people but it happened and it became more and more segregated that's the challenging part and the narrative about North 24th Street being some kind of a great African American mecca there was some truth to that there were black businesses that started in the 1890s that lasted 25 30 years there were all kinds of different restaurants and cleaners and garages and grocery stores all kinds of different businesses owned by blacks but there were a lot of white owned businesses in that area too Jewish people continued to live there for a while and they continue to operate businesses in that area however and mass white people were flooding out starting in 1919 in turn with that vacuum that was created black culture began to thrive African Americans would rent the storefronts would get into the spaces that whites had left and they'd open up their own enterprises so lots of those formal and legitimate businesses and then a few other things started to come around in the 1910s a man named Dan Des Dunes D E S D U N E S I've got a great article about him on north oma history dot com Dan Des Dunes brought jazz to Omaha from New Orleans he was one of the very first jazz performers and definitely the most prolific through the 1910s and 20s he was wanted all over the place for his great music great fun he played for the Omaha chamber of commerce he played for father Flanagan's Boys Town all kinds of different spaces and he was really popular along North 24th Street he was an African American man and he just made great music that jazz began to set the tone though the tone for 24th and Lake that set in for the next 40 50 years after that tone was the African American culture that emerged during the 1920s as part of the great Harlem Renaissance and what we understand as a Harlem Renaissance North Omaha had wonderful culture emerge there were jazz musicians there were jazz clubs there were uh speakeasies there were writers who came from North Omaha along the way newspapers came out now African American newspapers have been running North Omaha since 1880 but by the 1920s there were competing African American newspapers they were so prolific and so popular there were competing African American newspapers remember that was the way the people got their news back then that's it no internet no television no radio all through the newspaper and so competing newspapers there black congregations and churches of all stripes began to emerge especially as white congregations started to move out of the area those immigrant European congregations that I'd mentioned they were moving out and African Americans moved into their churches one of the churches it's still open today that bought a church way back then around 24th and lakes is called Cleves CME Cleves Memorial CME uh it's south and west of the intersection 24th and Lake another one is Pilgrim Baptist there are so many churches that were started by these white congregations African American congregations took them over and they're still operating today powerful powerful institutions in the neighborhood but we have this jazz corner come around at 24th and Lake and the whole thing took on this vibe especially Fridays and Saturday but even Tuesday night Thursday night the places were wild and fun white people would come up from downtown Omaha they come down from further north in Omaha they come from the west Omaha all the way out at 42nd street they'd ride those street cars they'd drive their cars they'd come down to 24th and Lake and they'd swing all night they'd listen to jazz music they'd drink martinis and they'd have roaring good times you surely know that there was more than one cosmopolitan that was poured out then more than one you know all the old-fashioned drinks the old-fashioned itself you get the idea it was a swing in place there was there was a grift that was going on there was crime that was going on north Omaha was notorious for having these crime lords who have been operating since the 1890s and these guys were in cahoots with the big guy with Tom Denison himself they called him the old gray wolf in the 1920s the old gray wolf had been active at Omaha at that point for more than 30 years and 24th and Lake was one of his hot spots well ran by his lieutenant's as African American lieutenants who had a finger on all of the crime in north Omaha a guy named Harry Buford another guy named Crutchfeld all these guys they were active right around 24th and Lake Crutchfeld liked it so much he built a duplex next to his friend Broomfield Broomfield and Crutchfeld they had a pair of duplexes right over at 24th and Lake just just west of their 25th and Lake actually those still one of them the duplexes still stands today and it's part of the national register another institution started to emerge right around them the black elks and other fraternities they started to come around 24th and Lake and they were African-American fraternal organizations white fraternities had already been there and they'd left when the white people moved out but in the 1920s these black fraternities emerged there were all kinds of social clubs and women's clubs and all kinds of events happening around the neighborhood that made it very vital and vibrant in addition to that jazz corner by World War II we had seen the emergence of the dreamland ballroom the Omaha star newspaper McGill's blue room the offbeat club and many things that it was before that all these places had come around they were hot spots they made north Omaha great but they made 24th and Lake vibrant it was on fire in a wonderful way World War II brought the great calm is what I call it the great calm to north Omaha especially to 24th and Lake between the end of World War II and the beginning of the 1960s this 15 year period north Omaha was filled with trolleys and suburban development the whole neighborhood had filled in along 24th Street all the way up to Minalusa all the points in between had houses and businesses there were so many businesses in the 1950s all around 24th and Lake was a vibrant commercial area something happened at the beginning of the 1960s though that white flight continued when African-Americans were given the rights that they were owed through the Fair Housing Act white flight happened whites moved out of Coons Place just north of 24th and Lake whites left their congregations especially the north Presbyterian Church which was right north of 24th and Lake they left other congregations finally all around the area around 24th and Lake they also left their businesses Steve and they started to move out to West Omaha that wonderful region between 42nd Street and 72nd 72nd was even developed at that point but they left they abandoned the neighborhood and in their place African-Americans the African-American population grew more blacks wanted better housing they moved up to Coons Place they moved all around the region but that vital commercial area around 24th and Lake started to turn south in the early third during the early 1960s it started to get uh storefronts were emptying out there were no recreational activities for black youth whether they lived down at the Logan Fottenell projects near 24th and Paul Street whether they lived in the houses spread throughout the entire region between north 14th the north 30th from coming street all the way north up to Saratoga there were just weren't activities for African-American youth white youth had activities there were swimming pools to the north and middle loose and belved your neighborhoods that African-Americans weren't allowed to go into because segregation was in full force by the 1950s in Omaha then in 1966 the intersection of north 24th and Lake streets became notorious for a different event it happened in July when there was a hundred degree days for multiple days in a row black youth started to hang around on the corners of 24th and Lake like they always had you know Steve in 1950s there were doo-wop groups that sang at 24th and Lake doo-wop and there were all kinds of fun-loving good times that were had pool halls and movie theaters and bowling alleys but those were shut down by the 1960s and by 1966 and the hot summer days of July African-American youth were standing at this corner of 24th and Lake did somebody through a rock through a window somebody else through a brick somebody else smashed out or another window and the first riots happened in July of 1966 and they continued on Steve for the next three years not straight through there was a national guard gathered at 24th and Lake to fight African-American youth there were national guard that went to the intersection to quote protect the businesses there were fire trucks that came through that were attacked by rioters there were people who died the riots happened again and later in 1966 in August they happened again in 1968 1969 in 1969 just south of 24th and Lake a 14 year old girl was playing with her friends in an empty public housing unit and Logan Fontenel projects her name was Vivian Strong Vivian went out when she heard that the police were coming as she ran into an alley and a white police officer named loader took out his pistol and shot this 14 year old girl in her back in 1969 Steve the writing after that went on for a week buildings up and down 24th street were absolutely demolished an entire block of buildings at 24th and Burdett was firebombed there are some questions about who set those fires whether it was the rioters or white property owners conveniently disposing of their own building but i'm not here to throw gas onto that fire i'm here to say that the riots happened between 1966 and 69 they had a devastating effect on 24th and Lake by 1970 the riots were mostly over there were small uprisings that happened but another event happened right at that time when the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations had an operation in Omaha that targeted two African-American young people who were leading all kinds of civic campaigns around the neighborhood they started newspapers they were active in the black panthers who started uh morning breakfast food programs for kids in Logan Fotnell their names were David Rice and Edward Poindexter David Rice eventually went by Mungo Walinga he passed away a few years ago in the Nebraska State Penitentiary Edward Poindexter is still there today after they were convicted of murdering an Omaha police department officer who went into a house that was bombed Rice and Poindexter were sent up state and never let out again multiple appeals have been turned away by the governor of Nebraska today as well as for the last 40 years of their lives Mungo Walinga passed away in prison after having all of his appeals denied Edward Poindexter is an old man now and he's hoping to get out just because he's old but who knows their case has been proven not to have been them but there's a wonderful author named Michael Richardson who put together the case on their favor to show definitely that they were not guilty of doing it that case won't be considered by the Nebraska Pearl Board it they won't consider hearing Michael Richardson's arguments that all happened around 24th and Lake in the 1970s early 70s by the late 70s the entire strip was devastated businesses had moved out buildings were boarded up and emptied fire bomb buildings from during the riots were still standing and then the city of Omaha went on a campaign to demolish all of the blight urban blight they called it and they demolished buildings all around the intersection they demolished some of the corners of the intersection itself Chrissy drug had long closed in the 1920s they became Duffy drug and rebuilt after 1913 as a single story building that stood all the way into the 80s and then was demolished that three-story that was on the southwest corner of 24th and Lake on the northwest corner of 24th and Lake that three-story building that I mentioned with a grocery store that lasted more than 50 years and floors of offices and apartments above it that was demolished in the 1980s on the northeast corner there was a Safeway store that opened up in 1963 it was open for approximately four years before it was closed by rioting Safeway didn't want to continue in that area at that point they were trying to invest in the neighborhood before that but they were completely discouraged by the riots they closed they moved out that building set empty for 20 years before the Omaha industrial council figured out a way to turn it around and make it into a useful space that it still serves as today on north on the sorry on the southeast corner of 24th and Lake was the blue lion building it was renovated by an African-American architect who redesigned it and repurposed it with intentions of it serving as a restaurant which it did for a while after the McGill Club the McGill Blue Room moved out it was a restaurant for a little while and other things 24th and Lake had a hard time to haul during the 70s and the 80s into the 90s. Non-profit built a brand new building the family housing corporation built a brand new building and the north I'm sorry on the southwest corner of 24th and Lake in the 1990s that building is there right now and serves a wonderful social function for the whole neighborhood I mentioned earlier on the northwest corner they installed the Martin Luther King commemorative park in the 1990s that's there it's beautiful it's got a beautiful mural behind it other buildings around the intersection some of them still stand the Carver Bank building was built along Lake Street just to the west of 24th Street in the 1950s it's still standing it was renovated several years ago and was served as an art space for a little while and now it's empty but it's still there the building next to that was a mozzler mosque in the black mozzler mosque in the 1970s that building still stands but I think it might be empty next to that is the black elks club that's still going going strong beautiful building they need your support go down to the elks club and have some fun the block north of Lake Street along 24th on the west side is occupied by a lot of beautiful things today the love art and jazz center is a vibrant space for the community there there are businesses along that way as well as a fashion store at 24th in Ohio just the next block up from lake I'd mention the union for contemporary arts is renovated the blue lion and it's a beautiful facility now and is vibrant with all kinds of activity and then on the southeast corner we have that nonprofit so there's a lot going on at 24th and like today there's lots of local cultural movements social movements there's lots of campaigning and lots of activities and people are looking forward to a brand new north Omaha that's emerging there are all kinds of developments up and down 24th street that are very positive new housing new economic developments that are really changing the intersection and 24th and lake and really making into something different and that's a little bit about the history of 24th and lake and its vibrancy throughout Omaha for all times even to today and that is a history of 24th and lake street thanks for listening to the north Omaha history podcast with noted author and historian Adam Fletcher Sassy join us next week as Adam takes you on another guided tour through Omaha's dynamic past\", 'rssUrl': 'https://omahahistorygo.com/feed/podcast/', 'epTitle': 'History of the 24th and Lake Historic District', 'epDescription': 'North Omaha is screaming full of history, and the new 24th and Lake Historic District is a tremendous example of how thatâs so.

      "{'transcript': ' [Music] Hello and welcome to this glorious mess, big kids. It\\'s Mamma Mia\\'s podcast for parents who know it\\'s time to change the Wi-Fi password. My name is Holly Wainwright. I have two primary school-led kids and I work at Mamma Mia. I\\'m Andrew Datto and I\\'ve got three kids and we never change the Wi-Fi password because there\\'s only one person who knows it. She\\'s 16 and she drives our technological apparatus for the whole family. So we just go, \"Jasper!\" She comes up and she goes, \"Well, it\\'s not working.\" So, yeah, I get it, but we\\'re not changing it. She has got the best situation there. Don\\'t forget, you can also listen to our sibling show, This Glorious Mess, Little Kids, Every Monday. That\\'s where you\\'ll hear Tegan and Lee talk about their four kids under three. They\\'ve got their hands full over there. So, unless we show, Andrew and I talked about how our kids are digesting and talking to us about the Black Lives Matter moment that\\'s happening around the world as we record this. This week, we\\'ve actually got an expert on to talk to us about how racism and bullying affects kids and what we can all do to better model anti-racist behaviours. And is this Glorious Mess really possible without our nails and fails at the week? Of course not, but right now, I have got a happy story. You remember last week? I remember last week. I was not really like, I was not a happy story. I\\'m happy is the wrong word. It\\'s really the saddest place in the world. No, it\\'s an encouraging story. It\\'s a really encouraging story about what we were talking about last week when we were talking to kids about what\\'s going on in the world at the moment. And you were saying how your teenagers are schooling you. I was in the car with my daughter the other day and it made me very hopeful for the way the world is going because we were driving back into the city, we live in Sydney and where we\\'re recording the show, and we were driving back into the city and you got a really good view of the big new skyscraper that\\'s going up on the edge of the city. Amazing. At a place called Barangaroo. And I said to my partner Brent, I said, \"God, look at Barangaroo going up. It\\'s huge.\" And Mathilda said, \"Do you know who Barangaroo was? Mom?\" Oh. My 10-year-old daughter. And I said, \"Yeah, yeah. I think she\\'s a local indigenous woman and please excuse me as I may mangle this story a tiny bit, but she\\'s 10.\" Mathilda goes, \"Yes. She was Ben Along\\'s third wife. My 10-year-old daughter says in the back of the car.\" I\\'m like, \"Okay. That\\'s amazing.\" She said, \"The white people wanted Ben Along to fit in with them and he did and he traveled with them and he did all these things, but Barangaroo never wanted to fit in and wouldn\\'t do what the white people told her to do.\" And I was like, \"Wow. That\\'s amazing.\" And so then Mathilda goes, \"So what\\'s that building?\" And I said, \"It\\'s a casino.\" It\\'s a five-star hotel and casino. And she said, \"Well, Barangaroo would not like that having her name. How was my daughter?\" Did you know that about Barangaroo? Well, the thing is, I knew Barangaroo was a person. I knew it was a woman, but I didn\\'t know very much about her. But I corrected myself because that building isn\\'t called Barangaroo, right? The area is correct. The building is a casino and it\\'s called Crown. Okay. But the point my daughter could already draw in her mind at 10 in the back because she\\'s learning about Indigenous history at school. And I know she won\\'t be learning about it in a perfect way, but she\\'s learning about it enough that it\\'s going in that she\\'d already drawn the thing in her mind that that woman who the area was named after would not bloody like a five-star hotel being built that was called her. And I was like, \"Wow. The cultural conversation all the time at the moment is like, \\'Why don\\'t we know more about our history and why don\\'t Australians understand that? \\'And how do Australians understand about black slavery and all these things?\\' And it\\'s like, there is a generational shift happening there that made me positive, made me feel positive. And it\\'s coincidental that you tell that story with your driving with your daughter, and she said that, and I was driving with my daughter, and I said, \"You see that building? This is true. \"You see that building?\" I said, \"It\\'s amazing.\" She goes, \"Yeah, it\\'s like the foil of a ship sale or something.\" It is a very impressive building. Yeah, it\\'s actually beautiful. I said, \"So that is a casino for high rollers.\" And Bibs goes, \"Right.\" I said, \"Now, what do you think pays for that building to be made?\" She goes, \"I said, people losing money, right? \"So if you ever think gambling is a good idea, just look at that building.\" And that\\'s paid for by losers in casinos. That\\'s what pays for that.\" And she went, \"Right.\" You really are teaching these kids something. So today we have Professor Naomi Priest with us. Now Naomi\\'s an associate professor at ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods. That\\'s the Australian National University in Canberra. And her broad research interest is to integrate social and epidemiological methods. Now all of that sounds very complicated and fancy to me. But what she also is, is somebody who\\'s done a lot of study and focused on efforts to promote the world. And also to promote diversity and inclusion, particularly related to race. So we are going to talk to her today with some of the questions that we had from the conversations that we had last week about how to talk to kids. Just understand what\\'s going on in the world now. Sorry, kids can understand it. Thank you for joining us Naomi. My pleasure. Thank you for having me. Now can I ask you for all the kids and parents who are listening to this who are watching what\\'s unfolding around the world in this Black Lives Matter moment every day on every screen and every phone and every TV. What are the kind of impacts that we\\'ll be having on the kids who are watching and listening to that? That\\'s a really great question. And there\\'s a lot of evidence from here and internationally that being exposed to racism in the media and online, this kind of vicarious racism has a really strong impact on children and young people and then indeed on adults. It can impact on mental health. It\\'s kind of like this vicarious trauma and causing anxiety and worry, anger, of course, and that can play out in a number of different ways. And it can even have an impact on children\\'s physical health as well in terms of their, you know, they might be feeling that they\\'re saying, \"Daddy symptoms of a stomach ache.\" And then at a social developmental level too, of course, it can impact on children\\'s understandings and views of different groups. So it can reinforce stereotypes of certain groups, you know, that Black people are violent, for example, but it can also impact on children\\'s perceptions of how safe their society is. So it can have a really broad ranging and profound impact. There\\'s some research to show that, and even some work that we\\'ve done, that witnessing racism, whether it\\'s online or in the media or out in the community can have justice around the facts on children\\'s mental health and physical health as directly experiencing it themselves. So what kids are saying on the news, have you got the news on, and it\\'s full-blown in your face every day? Would that suggest that we should be limiting what they\\'re actually exposed to? I think that\\'s really important, really important to be limiting children\\'s exposure to what\\'s happening in the media at the moment, even for really young, I don\\'t know, we\\'re talking about older children today, but even for infants and toddlers, and they\\'re really young children, even primary school children. They\\'re not going to fully understand what\\'s happening on television, but they will pick up the emotion. They will pick up the fear, the urgency, the anger, the stress, and that\\'s going to have an impact even subconsciously on kids, and it might show up in these sort of fussy, unregulated behaviors or children acting out or internalizing. And they don\\'t yet have the skills and the emotional regulation to process all of that. It\\'s just really big stuff for adults to process and learning young children. What do you think about the way to talk to kids about this? Because obviously that\\'s going to depend very much also on your own background and your own perspective and all of those things. But I was saying to Andrew last week when we were talking about this, I\\'m an Anglo woman with white Anglo kids, and I realized when I was looking a lot of this discussion about the difference between being, I\\'m not racist and being modeling anti-racist behavior. And it made me realize that I\\'ve been bringing up my kids in something of a bubble of empowering bedtime stories and everybody\\'s equal and the world\\'s a wonderful place, which is my privilege to be able to say that. And then so now you\\'re sitting explaining to kids who are saying, why is that happening and why is that like that? That I\\'ve been literally whitewashing the world for them in terms of going, everybody\\'s equal and everybody\\'s happy. Right. That\\'s what you want them to grow up with. Exactly, but that\\'s it\\'s a really important point. And I\\'m white as well. And it\\'s something that I think about a lot too. I think a new city is a privilege. And when also when people say, how do you talk to kids about racism, like even that fundamentally is a bit of a white question. So there\\'s communities who experience racism, and who\\'s their lived experience every day. They know how to have the talk. They have to talk to children about how to protect themselves against racism. But the first thing I would say in response to your question, you\\'re thinking about your kids, first we need to think about what\\'s developmentally appropriate, right? We\\'re not going to talk to young toddlers and infants about racism and historical racism and trauma. That\\'s not appropriate. But very, very young children do notice these race based differences. They can internalize racial bias as preschoolers and learning racism, if you like, is a lot like learning a new language. So we need to be making sure that they\\'re not exposed to racial stereotypes, that they are exposed to diversity and storybooks. And they\\'re really important things to do. Really important and to normalize conversations about difference and about equity, but we can be the same and different at the same time. And actually, what I would say there too is particularly if children are exposed from very negative media portrayals of different ethnic groups or vibrational people, then having more positive storybooks to counter those stereotypes is really powerful, even in preschool ages and older as well, and you\\'re providing a counter stereotype to these negative portrayals as groups, right? So that is really, really important. And of course, the children who are from diverse cultural backgrounds or from Aboriginal backgrounds to see themselves portrayed really critical as well in storybooks, so that they\\'re not saying someone who looks different from them as scary or as different. But of course, limiting that and limiting that exposure to the media is critical. But as children get older, yes, it\\'s really important to have these conversations about fairness. I mean, any parent, anyone who\\'s been any time with children knows that it\\'s pretty young, kids know about fairness. As parents, we sit there all the time going, you know, that\\'s not fair. You can\\'t do that. That\\'s not fair. You can have a very heightened sense of fairness, isn\\'t it? Right. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, I guess there\\'s three things here. One is kind of Luke to a couple of things and I might go back to sort of talking about what\\'s going on in the media first and then the more broader conversation. The first thing I\\'d say there is that, of course, parent, we need to put our own oxygen mask on right before we think we\\'re having a really strong reaction to what we\\'re saying in the media or to racism that there might be experiencing or witnessing. We\\'ve got to look after ourselves first before we can have that conversation with our kids. The next bit is to your children are sort of overhearing conversations or being exposed to what\\'s happening. We absolutely need to be proactively having conversations and asking them what they know, how they\\'re interpreting what they\\'re seeing, ask them to talk about how they\\'re feeling, make sure they know that you\\'re doing things to keep them safe, for example, and then contextualizing it into the broader society. So it\\'s not that they\\'re seeing people being violent or being protesting because they\\'re bad people, for example, but because there\\'s some really unfair things happening. So building that empathy, teaching that perspective, taking, why do you think they\\'re feeling like that? Why do you know why they\\'re so angry? How do you feel when you see something that\\'s unfair so that they\\'re having that sort of safe space to process what\\'s going on and navigate their own emotions and fear and build that empathy and perspective and that\\'s more for older children. And parents know what their children can and can\\'t have a conversation about making sure that\\'s really developmentally appropriate. So ask them questions and let them answer. And then if their answers are not necessarily the right answer or heading down the right path to sort of help them with the information. Yeah, and like in a really gentle way, of course. How do you feel when something was unfair? Yeah, I get really angry. It\\'s not fair. They don\\'t come up with the right answers themselves. Yeah, there are some great books out there. I know it is American, but CNN did a great session on Sesame Street last week about talking to kids about racism, even some positive story books about Aboriginal children, you know, sort of countering that lamb with some more positive stories or even about how it might even be a different kind of peaceful protest. Like there are other ways we can protest. Sometimes we need to, you know, children understand these sorts of things. What are some positive ways we let the government know? We let the community know when we want things to be a better place and we want the world to be a better place. So kind of having that really safe conversation with children is really important. Talking about it is the key, right? Because in contextualizing and all of those things that you\\'re just saying is it\\'s the opposite of dismissing the conversation. It\\'s really important that we don\\'t teach children that we don\\'t talk about race and racism. Yeah. And that they can have a conversation about it. And, you know, for all parents, when their children to be able to come to them when they\\'re scared, when they\\'re anxious, and they need support to learn how to regulate and navigate their own emotions around. They don\\'t really be questions for children, particularly if they\\'re experiencing or witnessing racism towards people who look like them. You know, when we get to teenagers, you know, that\\'s the difference, you know, that teenagers don\\'t want to talk to their parents about it. Time is for kids are much more likely to want to do that. So then it\\'s, you know, maybe giving them access to the movies or some great resources through reconciliation Australia or even, I just saw last night that ABC is been putting up a whole lot of Australia and maybe, you know, right, there\\'s a whole range of resources that, you know, Aboriginal lead run organizations as well. Human rights commission\\'s got some content to so that young people can, you know, make really good use of movies and documentaries and other positive sources that can can teach them about the history of discrimination and racism and even the first so that they can then help have a conversation about how they can get involved in fighting it and being empowered to do something about it. Is racism largely a white issue? Well, that\\'s a really big question, Andrew. That\\'s a really important question. Being the good academic that I am, I\\'ll take it further step back. No, no, no, this is back. This is just background. Like, so does it work different ways in different countries? Right. So that\\'s the question is the majority versus the minority. So racism fundamentally is this system of oppression, right, which ranks groups, social groups into hierarchies, considered some inferior and other superior and then assigns value and resources and power to those groups, right? That\\'s a global system. So we know globally white people and white social groups are considered superior, right? And that\\'s a global phenomenon. Okay. So from a systemic level, white people can\\'t experience racism anywhere. You know, they\\'re the majority globally, right? Okay. Interpersonal discrimination, sure, that can happen at an interpersonal level between groups and racialized groups can perpetrate racism, discrimination at an interpersonal level, but at a systemic level, no. Does that help? Yeah, it does. It helps a lot. Because the white privilege, right? That\\'s good. That\\'s a good baseline question. Thank you so much. That has been very, very helpful. I think we\\'ve got so many, you\\'ve pointed us to so many useful places for our kids to learn more and such a good point about fairness, talking to kids about fairness as an entry point that everybody can understand. My pleasure. I\\'m very happy too. Thanks for having me. Nailed it. Failed it. Andrew, we\\'ve got nailed and failed. How did you do? Well, I failed so badly. I guess, remember last week we were talking about being schooled. Bibi\\'s gone, right? She\\'s having heard from her. Having heard from her once. No, once. Oh. Like she lied. She said she was going to call you every day. No. I\\'m actually a little bit torn. Do I want to, I don\\'t want to ring her every day. I mean, I just actually don\\'t want to intrude. I\\'ll ring her today. I\\'ll ring her when we\\'re done. But anyway, like it\\'s just. So, Jasper, right, with Bibi gone, the kitchen\\'s clear. So, Jazzy\\'s cooking, right? So, she comes in and she goes, \"I\\'m making bread and butter pudding.\" And I went, \"It\\'s disgusting.\" Bread and butter pudding is disgusting. She goes, \"Yeah, well, I\\'m making it.\" Oh, bread and butter pudding is delicious. So, I said, \"And then she\\'s got the white bread.\" So, we don\\'t ever have like that white white. No, you\\'re too posh for that, don\\'t we? Right, too posh. Oh, and I must have said three times, and then she finally, she put down what she\\'s doing, and she stopped, looked at me and she goes, \"Hey, Dad, when you cook something that I don\\'t like and I say something, I get in a whole lot of trouble for saying anything.\" So, I\\'m saying to you, I\\'m cooking bread and butter pudding. Maybe you should just stop speaking, wait for it, if you don\\'t like it after you\\'ve eaten it, say something then. And I\\'m just so excited. I know the gods, Parena\\'s giving it the right. And I just went, \"Oh, you\\'re right.\" I said, \"I\\'m so sorry.\" She goes, \"Yeah, just keep that in mind.\" It makes you get upset when I don\\'t like what you\\'re going to cook, so please don\\'t put that on me. Let\\'s just agree to just accept what we\\'re cooking and try it. Didn\\'t you try the bread and butter pudding, isn\\'t it, Siad? Because I bloody love bread pudding. I did. I actually don\\'t really like it. It was okay, and I said to her, \"What do you think?\" She goes, \"Yeah, it wasn\\'t good.\" Right, but to the point... That was a very good lesson for that. Oh my God. So I just looked at her and went, \"Yeah, wow, you ripper.\" Like, really. Yeah, absolutely. So it was an epic fail, but... A nail though, because you brought her up right, because that\\'s what she... Well, I think her mum\\'s got a lot to do, you know, she\\'s probably... Anyway, so that was really interesting. Like a really interesting family, you know, sit down, shut up. Here\\'s how the world\\'s going to work from here. How about you? We finally left town last weekend, and it was the first time since COVID, because we\\'ve literally been in our flat for three months or have a long, and it was the first time we\\'ve left town, and we went to the Blue Mountains, and it was heaven. And we stayed in this little Airbnb before that\\'s really rustic little cottage with an outside dunny and everything, but it\\'s just heaven. It\\'s on this beautiful escarpment with a view and all this stuff. Anyway, so we\\'re in Nature Heaven, and there\\'s no TV, and all the kids asked me every five minutes was, \"Can we have the iPads now? Coming on TikTok now? Can we use them?\" Or honestly, and I was like, \"Oh my God, I bring you the paradise.\" And we did run around outside Heaps, don\\'t get me wrong, but even when they\\'re running around outside, they say, \"Can you film this?\" What have we done? What have we done? So I think we\\'ll call that a fail that needs some improving, which is that they\\'ve spent three months cooped up in their house, and we\\'ve been throwing iPads at them to shut them up so we can work or do whatever. And now we\\'re letting them loose in the world again, and they\\'re like, \"This is nice, but it would be better if I was making a TikTok out of it.\" It\\'s not real unless it\\'s in here. So, yes, we\\'ll be working on that, and I\\'ll be reporting back. Did you have fires outside and stuff? We did. We had a campfire that had a fire pick campfire like, \"Well, you\\'re allowed to have fire regulations in the mountains.\" But we did that, and we did marshmallows, and it was gorgeous. And it was so nice, actually, Brent and I, not having a TV and stuff. We played trivial pursuit, we played scrabble. Wow. It was really nice old-fashionedy weekend away, but the technology... But the two of you played trivial pursuit. Yeah, kicked his ass. [LAUGHTER] Anyway, that\\'s all we\\'ve got time for on this glorious mess. It was glorious mess this week.

      "{'transcript': ' (upbeat music) From the swattering feet of the Mojave Desert, (upbeat music) To the unpredictable habitat of Tanzania\\'s satin getty. From the murky depths of the marina trench. From the exhilarating heights of mountains, Kilimanjana, you have the pleasure of listening to, from Chicago to the mast, the dumbass podcast. - What\\'s going on with you, Charlie? - I\\'m fine, Mass, man. How are you doing? - I\\'m good, man. I\\'m good. I\\'m good. I\\'m good on my head. - You\\'ve been out looting and robbing and protesting, is that why you have this? - Gotta have my face, man. They looking for me. - This high fashion. - They looking for me, brother. - Chicago flag mask on. - Oh, man, you like that? - Yeah, I got one of my own arrives somewhere. - Oh, there you go. There you go. You\\'re good, you\\'re good. - I haven\\'t been breaking into foot lockers though. (laughing) - Still in Jordan\\'s. - Yeah, for what\\'s going on. - Still in Jordan\\'s for the cause. - Hell yeah, still in LeBron James. LeBron James. - Good. - LeBron James. So what\\'s up with you, man? We took a week off, man. What\\'s going on? - We didn\\'t take a week off. You took a week off. - We took a week off, bro. We took a week off, man. We took a week off. - You gonna go out to the cabin in the woods and... - Hey, man, I have to do my getaway, man. Let me take a look. - Put the show on, hi, Edis. - Let me take that off. But yeah, man. Had to get away, man. Had a hell of a time. Everything was good. - Did you, uh... - I can\\'t be open static. - Did you see any bears, any deer? - No, man. No wild animals or nothing like that. - What type of cabin in the woods was this? If you don\\'t see any wild animals? - Just to get away, brother. Just to get away. - No birds nesting. - Oh, yeah. There\\'s some birds and shit out there. I was sitting on the railings and... Did you eat some wild berries? Running around in the grass with the shoes off? - Dude, what kind of camping you did as a child, brother? (laughing) - Did you become one with nature? - Nah, none of that. My son did get it, uh, almost attacked by a hulk. - Oh. - It\\'s white. - Okay. - What was he doing to the hulk? - Uh, he didn\\'t see the hulk. He ran on the one side of the porch. So I guess the hulk sort of camp over there. - He like that. - Hey, like that. - Yeah. It\\'s my territory. - He did it once in the morning and then he did it once in the afternoon. - Wow. - But that he was done with it. He was like, uh, uh, I can\\'t go out like that. - That hulk\\'s good. - Big enough to take him and fly off with him, you know? - Sharp to... Hogs are not that big, right? - Oh, summer. It felt a lot of them. Yeah. It\\'s a big, it\\'s different type of hogs. So they\\'re very insides. I don\\'t know what kind of birth this was. It was pretty big, though. They couldn\\'t have took off with him. You know? - They just scratched him up pretty nice. - Yeah. But no, man, I just need that getaway. Like I told y\\'all, man. Just switch things up for a few days. Went out there and, uh, just chilled, man. Basically chilled, spent time with the families. Um, uh, let a fire. Roasted some s\\'mores. - Okay. Did all the stereotypical stuff basically. - Everything is up. Chase bears around and he buries. Like you would talk to him. - Oh. - Is that not what people doing in cabins in the woods? - I don\\'t know, bro. - It\\'s either that or like some type of, uh, hillbillies coming to attack you or... - No, none of that, man. - Some zombies or something to attack the cabin and all y\\'all gotta get y\\'all guns and defend yourself. So none of that happened. None of that happened. I have an idea of burning the bliggity just in case, but none of that. - Sounds like a boring trip to me. - So what you do, man? You had a, you, you had a week off. What you do? - I didn\\'t have a week off. - You had a week off, bro. You had a week off from, you had a week off from us, a week off from me, bro. - Oh. - What did you do? - Not really because you were still based on me and stuff. So that\\'s not a week off from you. I still gotta get bothered. - We gotta stay, we gotta stay. I\\'m sorry, bro. - I\\'m still gonna get bothered by you. I still gotta get bothered by you. - Bro, I don\\'t know what\\'s in you. - Like, I just roll my eyes every time I see the FaceTime come with them. - Oh my god. - You do. - You gotta attitude today. - This guy. - Why you got an attitude today? - \\'Cause I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t loot any stores and get no Jordans or anything, so. (laughing) Nah, I got an attitude. - So nothing up with you, man. You didn\\'t, I know you had some days off to spend them taking your old man naps. - Try to get a little rest. Reset my sleeve, schedule a little bit. Be compressed, won\\'t work a little bit. You\\'re gonna take a couple days off every now and then. - Playing some destiny. - Playing that hair on. - Playing that hair. Oh, let me tell you something. \\'Cause I literally just got off destiny before we worked on a pre-show and everything. I\\'ve come to the realization that you are, you are a hard-ass taskmaster when they come to fucking destiny, bro. You are a hard-tass master, bro. - Oh, I don\\'t understand what you\\'re saying. - All right, okay, you\\'re not gonna understand. You give your cousin a lot of shit, bro. A lot of shit. And you give everybody a lot of people a lot of shit when they come to destiny. - Steel sharpness, steel. - I understand that, bro. But the trash I was playing with today, bro, let\\'s bro, pricing this bad, bro. Pricing, like, bro, these assholes, bro. I mean, straight doodle butter, bro. Like, I\\'m talking about like-- - They know what they\\'ve done, baby. - My fuck is getting in front of me. Like, they\\'re just clumsy. Like, you fucking oaf, you know what I\\'m saying? How is your power level bigger than mine? Like, more than mine. Like, it was, it\\'s-- - What were you doing, strikes? - Yeah, I was doing some strikes, bro. I\\'m telling you, I\\'m talking about literally running past me, not even reviving me and shit like that. Like, I\\'m breaking my neck to try to go save them all, fucker. You know? And, bro, I don\\'t know, man. When I, bro, it seemed like when I play versus, when I play with our strike team, with our team, with our, with our clan versus someone else, I mean, with some other people, bro, we move like a whale oil machine. As bad as you say other people are, we, we talk to each other, we coordinate, we, we, we, we move like a team. - Bro, when, when I\\'m the best person on the damn screen. - Bro, welcome to playing with random. That\\'s what happens when you play around. - God, what you call them, blue dot, what are they called? - They call them blueberries, it\\'s like-- - They call them blueberries. - Blueberries. But yeah, man, that\\'s, that\\'s literally, I wanted to talk to you about that. And we\\'re getting the destiny. I know some other things I want to talk to you about, I\\'ll talk to you about destiny later. - The main thing that\\'s going out there, still going out there is these protests and riots. - Why\\'d you put riots in quotes? - I mean, I think really riots, like, it\\'s all of these things really riots. - I think the first few days, there\\'s some riots. - The first few days were riots. People are still seeing they out there rioting. - Now, keep in mind, we\\'re coming back after this dude wanted to take a week\\'s vacation. So, I think it\\'s, it\\'s mostly calmed down at this point. - Yeah, but you still got people out there saying they\\'re rioting. Nobody\\'s rioting, right? Well, actually-- - Atlanta right now, they\\'re-- - Yeah, that\\'s what I was about to say in Atlanta right now. So, breaking news. It seems like it\\'s going down in Atlanta. They burned down-- - They burned down-- - What did the Wendy\\'s do, though, like-- - Right, that\\'s what I\\'m about to say. - Well, what did the Wendy\\'s do to the shooting guy? - The Wendy\\'s do nothing, you know what I mean? - Wendy\\'s do the shooting guy. - Yeah, brother, it\\'s like-- - What if he wanted their people to just like, don\\'t watch the news and you just want your spicy nuggets? You just want your spicy-- - Not even that, what if you just show up the work? I don\\'t mean the laugh at it, but-- - Oh, wow. - Again, what did Wendy\\'s do? Wendy\\'s didn\\'t do a damn thing. - I think at this point, people are so tired of it. That anything in the vicinity is gonna get, something\\'s gonna get damaged. - Yeah. - Because you have, you have decades and centuries of people not listening to the cries of like, stop killing me, you know? And this dude had a taser, I guess he, he got into a, he was sleeping in the Wendy\\'s, I think he was in the drive-thru. Either he was in a drive-thru, he was in the back parking lot sleeping, somebody called the police on him. And this turns out, it turns into him getting shot by the police. - Running away. - Running away. - Running away. - But he had a taser in his hands, so. - I mean, running away, though, I mean. - Right. - How, how do you fear for your life? How you and fear, how did you feel? - I mean, at this point. - In any way threatened or even inconvenient, well, it can be, it\\'s, but how did you feel any way threatened when the target you\\'re trying to pursue is running away from you? - I feel like at this point, they just train them to any type of threat at all. - Shoot first, shoot first, ask questions later. - Any type of, any type of threat at all, especially from, you know, a person with the caramel, skin completion or darker. Just, just neutralize it, and we\\'ll figure it out later. Which is why we\\'re going through, what we\\'re going through right now. I love seeing the, the New York police officer. I think he was the, he\\'s the head of the New York police union. I love seeing him go off, saying that people are treating him like animals and thugs and stuff. - That\\'s the funniest thing. - And then somebody, somebody\\'s super cut the video with all of them, like New York City police abusing people during the protest. - That, like, one of the most amazing pieces of video I\\'ve seen in recent years. - Bro, I can\\'t, like, when I first heard it, I couldn\\'t believe it, like, this man is literally saying, stop treating us like animals. - I\\'ve seen you, I\\'ve seen you. - I saw you ram a car into people because they were in your way. - Right, correct. - I saw you. - During a protest. - Push a woman down, push a woman out of the way. I saw a New York police officer as they were driving by, opening a car door, and hit somebody with it. As, like, full, full, full sprint in the car, right? But stop treating us like thugs. - Stop treating us like animals, really. - Even before this happened, I was watching videos, \\'cause we have a guy in the clan from, in the Destiny clan from New York. And we were talking to him about the way that, like, New York police just be beating people up, bro. Like, I think they work, they\\'re, well, it\\'s not even a question, they\\'re worse than Chicago police. But, like, Chicago police will get goony, but it\\'s like, they get goony with a certain type of person, and after a certain amount of time, right? - Mm-hmm. - Like, New York police, if you don\\'t do what they say, they gon\\' call 20 more people and just go upside your head. - Remember the one little scene from \"The Simpsons\" where the police pulled up and they had a box. And inside the box, it was called \"Little Head Buses.\" It was written on a box, \"Little Head,\" but it didn\\'t spell little, it was little. Like, \"L-I-L, Little Head Buses.\" - No, I don\\'t remember that. - But, yeah, man, that\\'s what it\\'s like. I mean, I hate to make light of a situation, man, but that\\'s what it\\'s like. It\\'s, I think me and you were talking before, and this just don\\'t seem like it\\'s gonna get better until some type of reform happens where-- - So, maybe we police the public different. - Are you with the defund the police stuff, or like, what do you think? \\'Cause defund doesn\\'t mean, like, abolish the police department. - Yeah, I think I\\'m there. I think I\\'m there. - It means take away some of their money so they can\\'t have all these toys and stuff. - I think I\\'m there. I think I\\'m there with defunding. Like I said, this whole thing is not gonna work with some type of authority. - Right. - This whole thing we got, this whole system we got, will not work without some type of authority. But the authority we have right now is just so, it\\'s so wrong, and it\\'s not, it\\'s deep rooted. It\\'s deeply rooted. It is a systemic problem with the police and how they interact with minority people and more so African-American people and more so African-American males. It is a problem. It is a deeply rooted problem. And I don\\'t think you can fix it from the top. I think you have to kind of rebuild it. - Yeah, I think at this point it\\'s gone off the rails. - Yeah, it\\'s such a problem where, like I said, you can\\'t fix it from the top. You have to get in, you have to get in them roots, uproot it, rebuild it and, because just they\\'re training. Like, it\\'s so, and here\\'s another thing. I don\\'t, I think a lot of these, a lot of these, these police, you know, the police habits from state to state differs so much. Like, you can use a chokehold here. You can\\'t use a chokehold here. You can do this over here, but you can do that over there. This shit needs to be uniform, bro. Like, it\\'s just, it\\'s always gonna be like that because even if you push that, let\\'s say, from a federal level, the states are still gonna be able to make their own rules. And, you know, you have some states that, you know, you just have totalitarian, authoritarian people in charge who don\\'t mind stuff like that. You got a bunch of baby trumps around here that would love to see stuff like that. - But here\\'s where defunding the police count. I\\'m not funding you if you\\'re not adhering to these practices. - But the state legislator has to be in charge of something like that. So if you have people in charge who are fine with that type of stuff, they will still be funded. \\'Cause they\\'re funded at a local level anyway. So, you know, I just feel like I\\'ve seen people, not to catch up, I\\'ve seen people say that in a lot of these cases, something like a social worker should be engaging in some of these calls. Like maybe this Wendy\\'s guy had you dispatched some type of social worker instead of somebody with guns. Maybe this guy would still be alive. And I actually saw a social worker. - That\\'s common sense, right? - I actually saw like a social worker on Facebook say that they have to restrain violent and mentally ill people all the time or intoxicated people. And this is true because in my hospital, you do have detox levels, you have mental health levels and stuff like that. And they have to engage these people all the time. And guess what? They don\\'t end up killing them. - Correct. - You know, they don\\'t end up killing them. So, you know, maybe if you just send somebody who doesn\\'t have a gun or a taser there and they just have to physically restrain the guy until he sobers up, maybe he\\'s still alive. - Correct. - Because from what, from my understanding, like I said, the guy was sleeping and probably intoxicated as well. That\\'s a bad mixture for cops. Cops shouldn\\'t be responding to crimes. They shouldn\\'t be responding to somebody sleeping in a car. \\'Cause it always seems to turn into something else. - I don\\'t know, man. It\\'s too much of it. Like in, again, we talked earlier, this ain\\'t gonna go away. This ain\\'t gonna go away until like deep fundamental change within the police system. And even the judicial system, the judicial system is not, I mean, the police ain\\'t the full problem. It\\'s the judicial system as well, that, you know. - One of the problems with the judicial system is it\\'s become an extension of the right wing, left wing, like war that\\'s going on, you know? So that\\'s something that\\'s really gonna screw up the judicial system even more than what it was before. So I don\\'t know how you fix all of this stuff, or I don\\'t have the answers. - I don\\'t know how you fix it. - Oh, go get some Jordans, go get some Yeezy\\'s. - You style Marvin, bro. - You go down to the magnificent mile and get some Gucci. - You style Marvin, bro. Nah, man, but yeah, man. Change needs to happen. Change definitely needs to happen. Another thing that\\'s, I want to talk to you about, kind of along the same lines as this, that it never really, it\\'s an issue that\\'s been going around probably for the last four, three, four, five years. And it was really heavy at one point, but like now it\\'s like not, I mean, now it\\'s even, it\\'s slowed down, but now it\\'s more prevalent. And it\\'s this Black Lives Matter versus all lives matter, like you say Black Lives Matter and that somehow it fends a group of people. - Oh, oh, life matters. - Oh, life matters, but all life matters. - I don\\'t understand why that angers people so much. - I have no idea. - I have no idea. - Let\\'s say, let\\'s say you go back to, when was it, when they attacked Pearl Harbor and we took all of the Asian people on the West Coast and put them in internment camps. If Asian people, let\\'s say that happened again, the Asian people started saying Asian lives matter. I\\'m not gonna be out there screaming all lives matter \\'cause I understand the context of what you\\'re saying. It\\'s like they\\'re so angry that you would try and equate a Black life to theirs that they have to scream all lives matter. As if you\\'re saying Black lives are more important. - It\\'s so crazy \\'cause like, okay, so I\\'m just gonna take the word. I\\'m again, I\\'m applying common sense to this. Black lives matter. - And you stop right there and you stop right there. - And we gonna stop right there. And that\\'s a sentence. That\\'s a sentence. That\\'s the whatever construction you have that have to have to create a sentence, that\\'s a sentence. - Right. - Lives matter, period. - Right. - At what point in that sentence, can you get white lives don\\'t matter or all other lives don\\'t matter, just black lives? - That\\'s the privilege, bro, that entitlement, them thinking that everything is theirs and they\\'re the most important things walking around. And I\\'m talking about the ignorant folks, not all white folks, but, you know, that\\'s where they\\'re coming from, bro. Like they\\'re making it about them. Remember we had the conversation. - You think, and that makes sense. Now you might have hit the nail on the head with this one, with the hammer. - You telling me that they are so wrapped up in their own privilege. And you say, black lives matter. - Right. - That triggers them to the point where, well, are you saying my life don\\'t matter? - Exactly. - Bro, bro, that is crazy. - It\\'s the same thing when, remember they were saying that all the Hispanics and Latinos were taking their jobs. They were jobs that they weren\\'t doing to begin with. How are they, are you in the fields picking fruit and doing landscaping and all these stereotypical jobs that we should do? - Take their jobs. - You\\'re not doing those jobs anyway. Like what are you talking about? Why do you care? - Take your jobs. - If you remove all of those illegals that are doing those low-wage jobs out there on the West Coast, who\\'s gonna fill those jobs? Are you gonna go get those jobs? - No. - They\\'re taking jobs away from us. Hard work in Americans. - And that\\'s the propaganda, bro, from watching these crazy ass channels, Fox News and the OAN networking. It\\'s just pumping them full of hate and stuff. - It\\'s all talking points, bro. - There\\'s no one thing that I\\'m talking about. - I\\'ve even seen them. I\\'ve even seen them. And I don\\'t, I\\'ve even seen them say, this is how you should argue this. - Yeah. - Point. It\\'s not enough to just not have opinions on their own. They\\'re actually teaching people to say when, so one says this. - Right. - You say this. - If you get into an argument, bro, that\\'s just talking points. - If you get into an argument with a person and they can do nothing but spew talking points at you, it\\'s a pointless conversation. - Yeah. - Because they\\'ve already locked themselves up in the barrier and they\\'ve barricaded themselves in the room with the bricks and stuff, so it\\'s pointless. You know, like there has to be some give and take with a conversation. You know, I might have a point or I might have a certain perspective on a topic, you know, but I\\'m going to listen to what you\\'re saying. You know, me and you go at it all the time, but I feel like most of the time we have, we leave with an understanding. It\\'s not just, you know, I\\'m right, you wrong. - Yeah, here\\'s my thing. And this is why like no argument or no, no debate will ever affect me, man. \\'Cause when I talk with somebody and I\\'m having a debate with them or I\\'m having a conversation and we have difference of opinion, I\\'m never at any point trying to change some people mind or see if anybody mind. And I think that\\'s why a lot of people get fucked up. \\'Cause they out here, they\\'re arguing and they\\'re so passionate about their opinion. - Right. - They get offended when you don\\'t change, you know, they mind don\\'t change or the other person, you can\\'t get them to see it how you see it. I don\\'t get no fuck. I mean, my thing in those conversations is just to get you to see my perspective. That\\'s really all I care about. Because I understand that we\\'re all gonna have differing opinions. So, you know, like I don\\'t agree with all the conspiracy theories that I\\'m seeing on Facebook, I don\\'t agree with all the Kyrie Irvin, they trying to catch us by making us play basketball stuff. Like, you know, he tried to tie it into racism, but you know. - You see, it\\'s smelling fish. - Something\\'s fishy. What\\'s fishy about them wanting to play basketball? - No, not even that. - So, multi-billion dollar business. - This don\\'t smell fishy at all. It just makes too much sense. These millionaires want y\\'all brothers to get up. - They want y\\'all to make that money. - Yeah. - What is fishy about that? - Maybe he\\'s saying that they want to put their lives at risk to make money. Maybe that\\'s what he\\'s saying. But I don\\'t think it smells fishy. I think that\\'s-- - Well, we know that for the cuckoo though. - Yeah. He believes-- - He\\'s rather good. - Flat Earth and all that other goofy stuff. - Can you answer that too? - He might be. He strikes me as one. He\\'s one of those people. - Like you said this early in one of our episodes, if you were flat Earth, but this is why you might be-- - Because it lines up with a way, or with a certain way of thinking. You know. - Oh. - And I\\'m fine with being suspicious of the government and questioning things. I\\'m fine with that. But you have to look at context and you have to look at history, right? Yeah, you have a few episodes of people playing around. You know, like the Tuskegee airman and stuff like that. Yes, that stuff has happened, but on the grand scale, it\\'s not something that happens all the time. So we\\'re gonna attribute small things and put them to the macro. You know, like we were saying earlier, like most people walking around, I haven\\'t been vaccinated. Most people in school have been vaccinated. How come everybody don\\'t have autism? How come everybody is not just dropping dead? - Correct. - It doesn\\'t make any sense. You know, so I\\'m fine for questioning. Like when they first put this COVID vaccine out, I\\'m still on the sideline, I\\'m gonna watch. You know, and I\\'m fine with that. If a bunch of people take it and nothing happens, okay. Seems like it\\'s safe. - I think it\\'s about that. Well before the coronavirus even got over here. - Because my thing is this. I think there might be a problem with it because I think like I told you before, they\\'re gonna rush it, they\\'re gonna fast track it. So it\\'s not gonna have enough trials to really see if there\\'s something in there that\\'s adversely affecting people. So that would be my reason for trying to hold back. But I\\'m a healthcare worker. I know at some point they gonna make us take it. \\'Cause I have to take a flu shot every year. I have to, unless I have allergic reactions. - I\\'m never taking a flu shot, bro. - I have to, I have to get them every year. - Never taking one. I\\'m not opposed to it. - I have to do a flu shot every year and I have to take a TB test every year. This part of the job. - Gotcha, gotcha. I don\\'t know man. It\\'s a bunch of craziness going on about black, but just back to the, \\'cause we kinda got off the beaten path, but the black lives matter and all lives matter. What will it make these people happy? - What if it was black lives matter too? - You know what, when you come up with slogans and organizations, I think people need to be a little bit smarter about understanding who they\\'re engaging with. So yeah, it probably-- - I ain\\'t down from confronting nobody. - Black lives matter, black lives matter. - It\\'s not about conforming, it\\'s about, it\\'s about insulating yourself from the ignorance. Because I don\\'t see how you can watch that video of that man. - What video are you talking about though? - The George Floyd video. I don\\'t see how you can watch that video and then turn it around and start talking about him being arrested and the things that he did in his past. His last arrest from what I understood or his last jail stint was in 2007, that\\'s 13 years ago. None of that has any bearings or what happened to him, right? So those are the people that you\\'re engaging. When Hillary Clinton said there\\'s a basket of deplorable, these are the people that she\\'s talking about. They use anything to justify their rationale. - He did a porn. - Like, why does that matter? - Yeah, right, he\\'s a bad person, he\\'s a bad man. - I\\'m sure, I\\'m sure John-- - George Floyd was a bad person. - You had John Gody, right? Or any of those mobster guys. And I\\'m just plucking stuff off this guy, not specifically talking about anybody. But they did bad things, right? But there\\'s also a group of people who would say that they were great to them. They did good things. You might have a child who would say that my father was great, I loved my father. So every human being walking around on this planet has a good side and a bad side. There\\'s people who could say bad things about you, there\\'s people who could say good things about you. That\\'s natural, you know, that doesn\\'t mean that you were literally the devil incarnate walking around, you know, snatching babies and throwing them into rivers and stuff like that, you know. So, these are the people you\\'re talking about. And I think more people just need to understand that. Like, racism is not going anywhere. It\\'s never gonna completely be gone. - No. - You know, because-- - Well, you\\'re always gonna have ignorant people. Like, some people just predestined to be ignorant, bro. Like, some people, some people dwell in that ignorance. They like being in that universe. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. - They\\'re more comfortable. I got some folks that work that just try and make the workplace miserable because that makes them feel better. There\\'s just-- - People just want to see the world burn. - Like Alfred said, some people just want to see the world burn. - You just want to see the world burn, bro. - You can\\'t get through to those people. So, stop trying. - That\\'s crazy, man. What about, what\\'s going on in Chicago? What was going on in Chicago? I don\\'t think it\\'s really happening anymore. - As far as, what is this guy\\'s name? Antonio Batista? - He\\'s not even in Chicago. - I know. - Well, he was talking about an issue that was happening in Chicago. - So, you talking about T.O. Ruckus? - T.O. Ruckus. - So, essentially, when the looting started here in Chicago, there were certain neighborhoods that were predominantly Latino and Hispanic. - Can you say what neighborhoods were those? Was it-- - As far as I know, it was predominantly Little Village that what we\\'re gonna talk about was happening. I\\'m not sure if it was happening in Humble Park and other places, but I\\'m sure to a smaller extent, but not to where it got out of control. So, they wanted to protect their neighborhoods from being looted, which is fine. That\\'s a noble thing. I have no problem with that. - I didn\\'t get \\'em prone with it. - But what ended up happening was that spilled over into attacking any black person that was coming up. - And that\\'s what I got a problem with. - You know, you-- - Definitely got a problem. - And the guy T.O. Ruckus made a video like frothing at the mouth, screaming into the camera, calling black people, savages and monkey people. - Yeah, I heard the monkey people. (laughs) - But, you know, a pregnant woman will snatch out of the car and stab. Like, how is that protecting your grocery stores and your village and your-- - Did they go after anybody? Did they go after any-- - Bro, there was plenty videos of black people just driving by. - That\\'s what I\\'m saying. Like, I haven\\'t seen any video of them actually going off after someone who looked like they were looting. It looked like they were just getting anything. - I saw one, I saw one where a tow truck like rammed a car where they had loaded up the stuff. But, and actually, I have another problem because we were on lockdown at the time, right? So the police literally did nothing. Nothing. When they drove by and saw 50 people on the street corner, they did nothing. And they knew what they were doing. - So you sayin\\' a police was-- - They were a part of it. - They were a part of it. They were-- - They were complicit in it because they weren\\'t stopping it. So when people have this grudge against police, it\\'s because of stuff like that as well. And when black gang members started, \\'cause these people were mainly gang members, so we left that little nugget out. So when a black gang members started coming through shooting, there were audio logs of the police on the scanner saying these gang members are shooting each other. You know what they said? Let them do it. - Let them do it. - Right, so this is why people have grudges against police because they\\'re complicit in certain things. Now you just have the story of, and we\\'re going somewhere else with this, of one of the alderman here is Bobby Russia alderman. I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s an alderman. His offices were broken into, and his office is in like a strip mall. So the police were just in his office, just challenging around. - As the strip mall was being destroyed. - Only couch, just to the proper porn. - They claimed that they were sent there to protect it, but you could literally have a squad car just sitting right outside of there, and they could have closed off everything else. But this is the foolishness that\\'s going on. The police are trying to send a message without us. This is what\\'s gonna happen, you know. But go ahead and address T.O. rookies. I went somewhere else. I mean, no, I mean, you know what? Like I said, I didn\\'t really see them. You say you saw one video, and there might have been some other minor incidents, but then yankin\\' women or the people that can\\'t defend themselves, innocent people going to or coming from work. - They killed a man in front of his daughter. - Yeah, I mean, and here\\'s my problem with T.O. Ruckus Antonio Batista, or whatever his name is. I\\'m thinkin\\' if anybody should be on our side. If any group of people should be standin\\' with us, who I\\'m not sayin\\' is goin\\' through everything that every plight that a African-Americans are goin\\' through, but if any group of people should be standin\\' with us, it\\'s the Hispanic community. - No, bro, because when you color this country and you wanna be greater than what you were, let\\'s say in your country, or even if you\\'re born here, you wanna be like the people in power, right? So what happens is people start seeing us through the lens of white supremacy. A lot of people don\\'t understand the only seeing black criminals on the news, only hearing about quote unquote black on black crime. That does a number on people. If you\\'re not aware of what\\'s goin\\' on, because the people in power control the narrative. So once you see that on the news all the time, you hear about these statistics in Chicago, you drive past certain neighborhoods and you see people hangin\\' around on the corners, and that confirmation bias stuff kicks in, you know. So that\\'s all that is. - I mean, you have that all-truistic thought process going right now, but human beings are not like that, bro. They\\'re very easily led astray. - When I heard his racist, I\\'m gonna call it a racist rank. I wanna heard that racist rank. - When you look at this gentleman, you can\\'t tell he has black blood in there somewhere. - Here\\'s the thing, you know me, and you know most of my family and most, well most of my girl\\'s family, and even my sons, they\\'re half Dominican. This guy, you know, Ruckus is a Dominican. He\\'s a Dominican male. My sons are half Dominican. Everybody on my other side of the family are Dominican. - Right. - I\\'ve never, never heard anybody talk like that. (laughing) It triggered me, bro, it injured me because like, bro, we got a house in Dominican. Like, I\\'d never even heard nobody talk like this. It was so crazy that it triggered me, bro. I got somewhat triggered by this. And I\\'m like, this corn ball. Look at this corn, bro. And then I start looking at other videos where he\\'s saying, actually, no, this wasn\\'t said to, I didn\\'t actually see that. I did see some of his videos, and I was disgusted by them and some of the topics that he has, but this was actually said to me by another YouTuber, Viva Bella, who happens to be also on my girl\\'s side of the family. - Okay. - And shout out to Christina, shout out to Viva Bella. She\\'s doing big things on her YouTube page. She was telling me how in one of the videos he was saying that Dominican Republic needs to get more Europeans there and start getting rid of the Haitian population, \\'cause there is a huge Haitian population that lives in Dominican, works in Dominican, they\\'re armed, and they have their own struggles. They have their own flights there. But that\\'s crazy. Like literally saying, let\\'s whitewash Dominican Republic. - Bro, that\\'s the plan in the goal. The goal of white supremacy, bro. If people don\\'t think that this is, it just kills me how people don\\'t believe like systemic racism exists. Like a lot of these things are systems that somebody set in motion way back in the day. You know, and now it just becomes norm to people. So they think that that\\'s the way things should be. So when you have these protests, you get people who are angry at the protests. - Yeah. - Why do you want to change things? That mentality. - Again, just think about what a whole of these useful protests are rights. - But just think about back when Martin Luther King was protesting this stuff. It\\'s the same sentiment. Why do you want to change things? Things are finding the way they are. - America is great the way it is, son. - Exactly. - It\\'s great the way it is. I\\'m over here a bit. Just \\'cause you\\'re not as doing as well as me don\\'t mean we need to change everything. - I also love the sentiment of what does looting have to do with anything. Is this how you honor George Floyd? And it\\'s like, bro, you had somebody trying to peacefully protest this stuff and y\\'all kicked him out of the NFL. Talked all this, they called him a son of a bitch and all types of stuff. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I haven\\'t got one further for you, Todd. You had someone that was peaceful processing for years. - Right. - And y\\'all killed him. - Right, Martin Luther King, right. That was gonna be my next point. And you had that brother peacefully processing and y\\'all shot him, right? Now they didn\\'t shoot Kaepernick, but he was black balled out of league. He wasn\\'t the first athlete black balled out of league. You had Craig Hodges, you had Mike Moore would up do. - Mike Moore would up do. - How about Lee? - How about Lee? What else mostly for Vietnam? - Yeah, Steve. - You had Mike Moore would up do a row for AKA Chris Jackson. - What do you, he sat down for the national end. - Right, this has happened multiple times. And if you don\\'t learn from history, you\\'re bound to repeat the same mistakes. So you had people peacefully protesting the NFL, trying to shut them down. They tried to hire your boy JZ to come in there and calm everything down. I wanna say, we had a heated debate in our chat about this JZ stuff, right? This not, it\\'s not Asian well for JZ right now. - It\\'s not Asian well at all. - Like I told you, I needed enough info. - It\\'s not Asian well at all. - I needed enough info on him. I don\\'t see anything he\\'s done. - I feel like he\\'s on the wrong side. He\\'s on the wrong side of this coin at the moment. - Yes. - If I was him, I wouldn\\'t say anything about protests or anything \\'cause they gonna bite into his ass. - Just run. Just stay away from this subject, Mr. JZ. - But like, I just don\\'t know if any NFL has said we were wrong. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. - What did he say? We were past moving that. - I think we were past kneeling. - We were past kneeling. I didn\\'t fully understand what he was trying to say. - He was saying we need to get the conversation off or caffeinated. That\\'s what the whole point of that was. Let\\'s move this conversation away from this dude and his kneeling, right? For me, like I told y\\'all in the chat, that was a business opportunity for him, right? He figured he was gonna kill two birds with one stone. He was gonna get in there, make some changes, make some progress, but he was also gonna go get a cushy business move. He was gonna get a cushy business move for his company, which is what he was trying to do. But that brother has told y\\'all numerous times who he was, you know, he a businessman. I don\\'t mean I understand it. - So you do go with the fact that he sold out? - I mean, I\\'m not, when I said that, I\\'m not saying it in a, like he\\'s a Sambo. - Oh, what? - He\\'s an Uncle Ruckus. - You see a Sambo? - Yeah, I\\'m not saying it in that sense. I was saying it in the literal sense of what selling out is, right? You\\'re selling a little bit of your, I wasn\\'t saying it like he was selling out black people. I was saying it like he was selling out a little bit of his dignity for that money, which I felt like that\\'s what he did. - So you can, he\\'s shucking and driving for this money, for that, for that. - I think he, I think he, I think he took the bag. That\\'s what I think. - They got a spot like selling them and he\\'s just doing the charts. - I think he, I think he took the bag, bro. Like, yeah, but I\\'m not saying that he\\'s gonna, he\\'s gonna be 100% right, white, white, Washington or anything like that. I like what him and his wife have been doing as far as putting messages and imagery and their music, I appreciate that. - A lot of philanthropy too. - A lot of philanthropy as well, I appreciate all of that. And that goes to say this as well. All arguments and all opinions are not one-sided. Like, I\\'m not against Jay-Z. You know, I don\\'t wanna quote unquote cancel Jay-Z or anything like that. I just felt like he picked the wrong, the wrong, he made the wrong choice at that time. I felt like he was motivated by money. You know, but now, a year later, and you got another black man, Q, in a grotesque way. - Oh, pretty good. - Yeah, Colin Kaepernick, Colin Kaepernick looks like him. - That a lot of black man was key. - He looks like a prophet at this point, especially the way that the man was killed. You know what I\\'m saying? Like, what if that cop was trying to make a statement with the way that he killed him by Nail and all his neck? - But I think he did. - You think he was doing what he was doing? - No way, bro. - They gotta know each other. It has to be a motive, right? - No, no, wait, we know that. That\\'s been proven already. But it\\'s like how ironic is it that Colin Kaepernick was kneeling to protest police brutality. And then a year later, well, not a year later, some years later, a cop kills a guy by kneeling on his neck. How ironic is that? Tell me the universe doesn\\'t have a sense of humor. Tell me there\\'s no irony in the universe. - Like we said before, bro. Me and you had a conversation a few days ago. It\\'s all a simulation, bro. - This is a goddamn matrix. - This is a simulation we live in in a matrix. - Well, I\\'m just waiting for the Nio character to arrive. - I can\\'t wait to have that discussion with you. That gotta be a whole show that we live in in a simulation. Or is this-- - But you know, if you really pay attention, I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever paid attention to this, but the story of Nio is like written like Jesus. - Yeah. - Yeah. A lot of people have never paid attention to that in the matrix. - Mm-hmm. - So, I don\\'t know. Maybe the Wachowski sisters now, they were the brothers. Maybe now the Wachowski sisters. Maybe they know something that we don\\'t know. - Bro, that was so funny. I think we were talking a few years ago, and you were like, yeah, one of the brothers. - You said no. It\\'s both of them. - No, bro. What the hell did this happen? - I\\'m like, it seemed like maybe three or four years after one with the other one. - Yeah. I didn\\'t know. I don\\'t know, bro. I get a breast of certain information, but other stuff. - But usually you know shit like that before I do. You always seem to know things like everything. - Things like that, right? - You\\'ve heard me saying the chat I saw it and I moved on with my life. That\\'s what I\\'m trying to do nowadays. Now speaking of the Wachowski sisters, we probably say we weren\\'t going to bring this up. And he\\'ll Harper had addressed the Wayne Wade\\'s son as young man, right? And people went off on him on Twitter saying that he was committing violence against a trans person, which is like stuff like that. - I don\\'t know how you go from point A to point B that fast. - Bro. - That\\'s not even point A to point B. That\\'s point A to point Z. - That escalated so fast, like what are you talking about? - Now, what\\'s he trolling? Do you think he just slipped up in the middle? - I think that\\'s not part of his belief system. So he addressed him as what he biologically is. The boy still has his penis and everything. I mean, he\\'s still a boy. He just wants to hit him. - I\\'m going to say he\\'ll Harper was in the wrong way. - Okay. That\\'s fine. - I don\\'t really care either way. - To say that he was committing violence against a child, it\\'s crazy. That\\'s absolutely crazy to me. - So, let me say, I think he was trying to insert his opinion when it wasn\\'t asked for. - Right. - But at the same time, come on, people. - Violence. - That\\'s crazy. - I mean, are we, are we, are we, are we that, are we that? - My stance is this. That\\'s not my household. So Duane Wade and his wife can do whatever they want to do in their household. I wouldn\\'t do it in my household and that\\'s nothing against gay people or trans people. I\\'m just, I\\'m not going to, I\\'m not going to, I\\'m not going to enable my 12-year-old son to act and dress like a woman. Like, if you want to do that when you\\'re a little bit older and you\\'re 100% in control of your life, fine, so be it. But I\\'m not going to push that narrative because you never know, boy, kids think they Superman one minute, they think they bulletproof, they think they can hold fire and they do all types of crazy stuff. So, you know, they\\'re one way, one minute and they\\'re, they\\'re another way, the next minute. Like, you could be going through a phase, who knows, you know, so I wouldn\\'t, I wouldn\\'t put my child in that, in that box and run with it as hard as they\\'re running with it. But, you know, more power to them. God bless them. I hope they\\'re all happy. Well, that\\'s State House hole, like you mentioned before, that\\'s State House hole. If that\\'s the way they want to run it, you ain\\'t, like, none of that, that\\'s happening over there. Got nothing to do what\\'s going on in my house. Right. And I\\'m not going to, I\\'m not going to make a judgment or determination of it again. I\\'m going to run, I\\'m going to run my house hole the way that I see fit to run my household. You can run your household the way you see fit to run yours. I know people personally, they got like, they, they, they are, they\\'re like bother about it. It\\'s like, I don\\'t go down that path, bro. Right. I see, I see stuff. I see stuff and I move on with my life. Okay. There are certain things that I can\\'t, like, like seeing black men die at the hands of the police. I\\'m kind of tired of seeing it. I\\'m kind of tired of hearing about it. But then there\\'s other things I just don\\'t have the energy for, bro. I just want to play some video games and raise my kids and pay off my mortgage, you know, and buy a little motorbike. That\\'s what I\\'m trying to do, bro. That\\'s what I\\'m trying to do for my, my immediate goals. Oh, well, since you want to, what you say, you move and you, you see stuff and you move on. Let\\'s see. Let\\'s see. Let\\'s see that. Let\\'s move on. Let\\'s talk about this PS. Let me actually, before we even get deep into it, it was supposed to go down, like, on a second of June, or, you know, early, what happened, like, why did the police protest? Because the police protest, um, why was that delay? Because they didn\\'t want, they, they wanted to focus on their event. They didn\\'t want to. They didn\\'t want to. They felt like, well, they said that more important things were going on at the time. But of course, they just, they wanted to focus on the event when they dropped it, you know, they, they didn\\'t want to clash with, with, uh, the protesters being out there tearing stuff up in the end. I\\'m not saying that they, they were concerned about people seeing it because it, in my opinion, it was the right thing to do. There are more important things going on because this is a, this was a worldwide protest. So now you don\\'t want to have an event as that\\'s going on, you know, just push it back. It\\'s a digital event. It\\'s not like it was, they were having to add, uh, at E three or anything. I think it was the right thing to do, but I\\'m also going to say they just wanted people, they wanted more eyes on the event. Of course. Of course. Like I said, everything is not black and white bro. There\\'s a great getting in there. So they probably felt it was an important thing, but they probably also wanted people to actually see it. But what did you, what did you think of it? Did you watch it? By the way, cause I know how you, I know how you are you, you know, you, I do not watch it live. Somebody said, somebody says you a link and you get to the link like a five weeks later. I, I meant, I had every intention of watching it live, but at the time I was trying to edit video and, uh, my Mac was just, I can\\'t wait till this PC is done. Are you ever, are you ever going to buy another Mac? Well, you just not going to use it, you\\'re just not going to use it for more important stuff. I like, okay. So I like my Mac when I\\'m away from home, I think it\\'s a great PC in that aspect. I wouldn\\'t, I\\'m not PC, it\\'s a great computer in that aspect. If I can even call it a computer, it\\'s a computer, um, for indoor use when I\\'m trying to edit and trying to do other things and I\\'m trying to figure out where it\\'s all my data going, like, why don\\'t I have data on this thing? I\\'ll, I\\'ll have 20 gigs one day. I\\'m like, oh man, I got 20 free gigs. And then I do two things and now I got four gigs like the next day, like what, what just happened? So, um, yeah, and that, and that aspect is good, but what I thought about, what I thought about the event, bro, how many games that they, I\\'m going to go, I\\'m going to do a list. They showed a lot, but a lot of those were third party and indie. I mean, they had, uh, you sent me this, I\\'m looking at it right now. You said this. Spider-man. Miles Morales. That looked good. Spider-man looked good. That will, that will be something I get first day. Like that, that looked really good. Did you play the other one on PS4? No. Okay. I\\'ve seen it. I didn\\'t play it. I couldn\\'t go. I didn\\'t believe that. This one. I didn\\'t play it either. Here\\'s the thing, like, I\\'ve, uh, I\\'m going to get it because my son\\'s going to love it because we, I remember taking him to actually, actually, actually see this Spider-Man movie, what Miles Morales. Okay. You enjoyed that. Um, Gran Turismo 7, um, I\\'m going to get it, but, you know, bro, four, four is going to destroy me. You bro. We, we fucking around with four is a too much to ever get involved in the game through it. I had to last Gran Turismo for the PS4. Okay. I did not like it. I did not like it. It was, it was slow. It didn\\'t, it\\'s like you have to get these licenses and badges before you could even do it. No, just get me in the game, coach. Like I don\\'t, I don\\'t, why do I need, why do I need to do a four point time before I play the game? I used to love that about Forza, um, Gran Turismo. I\\'m sorry, Gran Turismo. I used to love that getting the licenses and stuff like that. Not so much anymore. Bro, let me play the game. You know what I\\'m saying? Like that turned me off so much and I did, uh, wind up getting, getting, uh, uh, I didn\\'t wind up there. There you go. There you go. That thing looks like a router. That\\'s what everybody\\'s saying, but I\\'m, look, look, I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m going to get back to the game list since we are looking at the, uh, I\\'m looking at it. I\\'m going to put this on a loop. So just go ahead. Um, what\\'s up with this weird ass design, bro? It looked like the BMW i5, bro, like, yeah, I think they\\'re, they\\'re trying to be sleek. So you know, I think it\\'s us, I think it\\'s a little over designed as far as the aesthetics of it. They could have made that thing all black, like, uh, now I\\'ve seen some people photoshop it. But it looks, it looks way better. It looks better black, but that looks weird, man, like, I, it kind of reminded me of them room, but like, I don\\'t know, bro. It\\'s a room. Yeah. Like the white, like some type of, uh, like, wally, you remember the little Pixar, like it just looked so weird. And like it said, they look like they tried to come out with something that looks state of the art, looks sleek, let\\'s stylish. And I just think it looks weird, bro, like, I\\'m not the only one. This one is on the screen now. This is horizon, uh, wild west or something like that. These are forbidden west forbidden west. These are the, the, the PlayStation style games that I\\'m kind of into this and the God of word type of stuff, um, I do like, uh, tech stuff, like cyberpunk type of stuff. Um, and this is like, uh, uh, a wasteland type of scenario that has tech monsters in it. Um, so this, this is my, this is good. Yeah. This is up my, of my avenue right here. I don\\'t think this is something like I got to see more on it. I mean, just right. It looks good. It does the, it looks good, but it doesn\\'t look interesting enough to be that. Oh, so you were, you weren\\'t interested in the first one at all. Mm. Okay. Um, I don\\'t know, man, between that weird ass design, they came out with, and I\\'m still going to get it. You know me. I\\'m still going to get it, like, get every system that come out. Mm hmm. That looks good right there, man. That looks beautiful. It looks really good. Um, ratchet and clink. They got that one coming out. Oh, that one. My God. That\\'s the father. I, I think ratchet and clink, uh, is going to be a good one. Um, I think that\\'s going to be a good one. Uh, that, that, that looked real, that looked, that looked, that looked pretty good. I could see my son, uh, really enjoying that one. This is the spotter man joint. That was really good, man, but no, I can\\'t do it. What about a project at the, uh, I didn\\'t see enough of that. I\\'m not really sure what that is. I thought they looked okay, but that could be more tech than most stuff. Who knows? What about, what about stray? I have no interest in playing a stray cat. Well, see, that\\'s that stuff. Remember when we went out, remember when we were talking about PlayStation games, and I was saying that they\\'re not my cup of tea stuff, stuff like straight. I have no desire to play a stray cat at all. And I saw some people. It is a game about a stray cat, hopefully saw people saying, this is amazing. I can\\'t wait. Like, what are y\\'all talking about? Bro, I hope it\\'s more than that. I hope it just ain\\'t a straight, you\\'re controlling a stray cat trying to get home. Trying to get back home. I hope it\\'s something different. I hope we\\'re just seeing a small segment of the game. That\\'s fucking weird. It\\'s dead. People put mutants a dollar, you get violent. They\\'re kind. They pay people. Right. They, so much, you know, so much, uh, brain, but, but, but they\\'re playing a game about a stray cat. They\\'re fucking crazy. They\\'re, they\\'re player based plays, stuff like that, but it is a game about a stray cat, bro. And they, they made it look beautiful. It looks really good. I just can\\'t play a game about a stray cat. Your answer is my looks good too. It does look good before it\\'s a horizon. That\\'s all I\\'m going to say. Two different games though. You can compare that to for the sports. Bro, I fuck them. I will fuck with for some motorsport. Yeah. I think I don\\'t think there\\'s a question more for some motorsport. Forza in general is, is I used to love Gran Turismo. It\\'s been the better. It\\'s been the better game for a while now. Um, and there\\'s a lot of other games, not turnal, I\\'m sorry, returnal, sack boy. You were telling me about sack boy. Well, that\\'s from, that\\'s from a little bit of planet. That\\'s a game that my kids used to play with. And they\\'re small. I used to play it too. It\\'s a pretty fun game. I don\\'t know if sack boy is going to be the same type of game or if it\\'s like it\\'s on store. Here\\'s Ratchet and Clank right here. Um, I mean, after that, bro, after like you\\'re a sack boy, right, everything after that outside of Godfall. Bro, I\\'m looking at a lot of stuff. I don\\'t really care about. Solar ash hit me in three. I\\'m like, maybe I got a season more. Yeah. So by NBA two K 21, I don\\'t mean that\\'s coming to the PC and the Xbox. So that was a really matter. I stopped. I got off the two K 21 being wagon, bug next bro. That\\'s another one in them. We\\'re at ones, bro. I don\\'t know. We\\'re at one\\'s death loop, resident evil, the village, uh, pragmatic. And the one we saw horizon, um, for being West, right, um, they did mission another one. What\\'s that? Uh, we get in GTA five again, they open, they open the event with GTA five like, bro, we, it\\'s, it\\'s been, it\\'s been, it\\'s going to be eight years by the time that comes out. I\\'m pretty sure I was playing GTA five when I Xbox 360. Yeah. This is crazy. What are y\\'all doing? Like, in this, like, I\\'m not even aiming this at PlayStation. I\\'m aiming this at rockstar, bro. What the fuck are y\\'all doing? They make it, they make it money, hand over fist. That\\'s what they\\'re doing. Oh, bro. I\\'ve been, I\\'ve probably talked about this at Nazino on a span of over span of shows that we\\'ve done. We want to see six, we want to see GTA six. It\\'s common, bro. It\\'s coming, but they\\'re making so much money with, with PlayStation. I\\'m a PlayStation, GTA online that they\\'re going to take their tie. Well, they could have come out with an expansion. They could have like a real expansion. I ain\\'t talking about like these, ooh, we got some motorcycles for y\\'all or ooh, you can go to the casino. No, this, this game right here, this game right here, which is definitely, um, it looks interesting. I\\'m not, I\\'m not sure I like the aesthetic of the graphics though. Is this the one with, this is the one with, um, they have some, yeah, yeah, I know. Okay. I remember this one. This is the one where every time he dies, he just comes back. This is like the, this is like the, it\\'s like two or three games. Is this the one where he had the sniper, like it\\'s, it\\'s a, it\\'s a person watching over him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But this game is like this and so is, uh, what\\'s the, uh, what\\'s the return? It\\'s like this where you dying, you just come back and it\\'s like part of the story, not just part of a part of a game mechanic. But like I said, um, back to GTA five, uh, like, I, I mean, it\\'s been enough time for y\\'all to give us another, you don\\'t have to make it a big story. Just give us a couple of minutes. Who do you think? Who do you think? Who do you think you are? What do you mean, you, you\\'re just one of their, um, yeah, contributor, you don\\'t get to call no shots. Bro, when was the last time you cut on GCA five, uh, we, I think we probably will. It\\'s been at least a couple of years, bro. I ain\\'t getting on that shit. I mean, I know the problem still exists. I could still be floating in the sky. It\\'s one of the 10 seconds. I can\\'t do it, bro. I could still be floating in the sky for 30 minutes before I can. You can play the game. I, I know they haven\\'t fixed those problems and I don\\'t even want to log on to see if they fixed those problems because it\\'s just so annoying in the deal with like if the game was so buggy, come out with something new, man, like, they don\\'t have to come out with something new. They\\'re making money hand over fist again. Who do you think you are? When they\\'re making millions of dollars, bro, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds of millions of dollars. They don\\'t get me wrong. I love GTA five. GTA online is just as a hassle, but like you said, if they still making money, they still making money. But what the fans really won\\'t is GTA six. Give us some. Give us a. No, I felt I heard something interesting with the way that they deliver that PS five. I mean, the GTA five stuff, they say that GTA online was going to be free for PlayStation and PlayStation now subscribers. So it sounds like GTA online is going to be a separate thing from play state from GTA five. The way that they worded it, you got to pay attention a lot of times because game companies will sneak little messages in there. So I\\'m wondering if the new GTA six is going to be separate like that. Like if they just release a online game and then they put the story is maybe I don\\'t want to say the story will be DLC, but it\\'ll be like a separate module that they had later. Maybe I\\'m not sure. Maybe maybe the online portion will be like this perpetual thing across GTA\\'s. I don\\'t know. It\\'s my hypothesis. I mean, they didn\\'t release GTA online. I mean, well, GTA five didn\\'t have the online part until after like that. Right. I don\\'t think they\\'re going to do that next time. I think the online part might actually be first that actually would be cool. And then and then let me get fully immersed in this this this vise city world. Unless you get episodic episodic content, maybe for the story part of it. What if they made GTA six like it\\'s a MMO? I mean, it\\'s kind of like that already. It\\'s not structured like a MMO, but it\\'s kind of like that already. It\\'s not like destiny where you got like stories, you know, you have a part of a story every time they are literally just releasing like vehicles and places to go. For me, they\\'re giving you ice. They\\'re giving you ice. I mean, there\\'s a little bit of story stuff in there. Yeah. Well, speaking of destiny, and we talked about it a little bit before the new expansion. How you feeling it? That\\'s not the new expansion. No, I mean, I\\'m sorry. The new season. Sorry about that. The new season is is cool. I mean, it\\'s okay. Seasons are just busy work. It\\'s just stuff for you to for you to do. Yeah. I\\'m feeling it. Man, that first open the scene kind of got me hyped the darkness, the darkness is coming. Did you watch? Did you watch any of the Beyond Light reveal? Did you watch any of the information? I can\\'t remember. I\\'ve seen so much destiny stuff that you sent me. So you didn\\'t watch the actual presentation. No, I got I probably I can\\'t remember it now. What was it about? That means you didn\\'t watch it. So they just went over. This is the trailer for Beyond Light right here. They just went over pretty much what most of the you saw this, but you didn\\'t see the presentation. That\\'s what I\\'m saying. You saw the trailers. You didn\\'t see the actual presentation. So they\\'re changing a bunch of stuff. They\\'re going to get rid of some planets. They\\'re bringing a lot of destiny one content and putting it into destiny two and the form of a vault each each year up until 22. So 2021 22 will have a brand new big expansion, I believe. So they\\'re doing a lot of a lot of stuff changing up the way that they deliver the game content. So from what I heard a rumor or whatever, destiny three was essentially like being broken up and put into destiny two. Yeah, you said that a while ago you were telling me this was about a year ago. You were telling me they probably wouldn\\'t come out with another destiny for like nine or ten years. Well, they said seven years. They said that last year, but it\\'s not it\\'s not they break it up. I\\'m cool with that. It\\'s not it\\'s not seven years from last year. It\\'s seven years from the release of destiny two. So I think it came out in 2017. So so 24 should be a hypothetically a new version of destiny hypothetically destiny. Destiny two came out in 2017. I\\'m pretty sure it did. Why do I remember destiny? Okay. Yeah, we\\'re taking of a DLC that I got. Yeah, this is this is year three of destiny. Yeah. Destiny two rather gotcha. Who\\'s that the drifter? That\\'s the drifter. Yeah. Here is more and the the stranger from destiny one, which you probably don\\'t remember. Yeah, man, I like I said, I was playing. I liked it, man. I like I like the new season. I like the little, you know, again, got hyped, got reintroduced, some of the stuff, you know, I can\\'t, you know, I tend to forget certain things and I do remember, I do remember that. Yeah. But yeah, some of the things I got re-introduced to as far as some of the story and I\\'m hyped man. I\\'m hyped for September. It\\'s coming out in September, right? September 22nd is one of the new expansion comes out, which is beyond like and then next year is the witch queen and then light fall is the year after that. So yeah, they\\'re breaking up the content and just doing big expansions every year, which they kind of were doing anyway, but I have a feeling that all of the expansions are just going to be bigger and broader like in and like, yeah, that\\'s, that\\'s what\\'s about the half. Give me large pieces. If you remember how big you remember how big forsaken was when we were chasing down the dude. So killgate. Yeah. It\\'s going to, it\\'s going to be on that level. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, man, I\\'m, I\\'m hyped for it. I\\'m, you know, hopefully by September, my PC should be built. So what? Yeah. I would hope so. God damn it. Oh, that\\'s PC is going to be done fairly soon. So my cousin just got a PC too. So you know, we can, he\\'s enjoying it. You know, he sees his eyes are opening as to why I\\'m always on my PC instead of the consoles. Yeah. You said I was on, when I was on Destiny, not a few hours ago, but when I was on Destiny earlier today, I was trying to, trying to nudge you to, you know, you didn\\'t have all you had to say was come get on the Xbox with me. I would have done it. I mean, got it. I saw the way you were into it, I looked on the chat screen, I didn\\'t, you were into it, bro. You were going to lick my weight. I was in the middle of, I forget what I was, I was doing something else. I\\'m like, I ain\\'t going to fuck with him. I let him play. I\\'m going to just sit over here, struggle and play with these fucking blueberries, blueberries. Get me killed or I\\'m already killed and they just run bad like, bro, you literally, you didn\\'t stop and revive me, bro, like, it\\'s crazy, man. It\\'s like, you know, I saw you, man, you, you were, you were, you were putting me in working on Destiny like, it was a nine to five, bro. What was this today, earlier today, when I saw you, you were like, I couldn\\'t even talk to you. I was, I forget what I was doing, I was trying to, I was trying to like, tie up some loose hands. Yeah. You on that, like, it was a straight nine to five. Oh, and speaking of nine to five, be some on. Okay. She need a nine to five man. No, she doesn\\'t want a nine to five man. Oh, no, no, no, you\\'re right, you\\'re right. She don\\'t want a nine to five man. Now, first off, I\\'m gonna say this, I think me, Simone, it\\'s hilarious, a lot of people don\\'t like her. I think she\\'s funny. I think she, I think she\\'s funny. I have her on Instagram. I\\'ve watched some little show she had. I can\\'t, what was the name of it? I can\\'t, I can\\'t think of the name of the little show she had. I would try to catch it. I think she\\'s funny, man. I think, I think she\\'s funny. She also got another, another friend that I watched too. She\\'s pretty funny too. So they kind of rock together on the show or on the IG, but I think she\\'s funny. But she came out with, she came out with a statement. She was on, was it Tia? No, Nick Cannon. She was on one of Nick Cannon\\'s, one of his shows and went on and she was, I think he asked, what kind of man she like or what kind of man is she into or got on, somehow got on that subject where she says she does not want a man that has a nine to five. What do you think about that? I mean, she\\'s treated have her preference, but you know, you can, what about you passing up your, your potential soulmate because you\\'re, you\\'re judging him based upon what his occupation is. I mean, what is, what is your real, your real goal? Is it just somebody who occupies a specific space or mindset, or is it someone that can potentially make you happy for the rest of your life or be your partner for the rest of your life? What if, what if, okay, so what if she\\'s not looking for a, what if she\\'s not looking for a soulmate, because me personally, I\\'m like, I don\\'t, I don\\'t really believe in that, but I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t say she was looking for one. I said, what if she\\'s potentially missing one because she\\'s judging them. She has these prerequisites that are, are, are excluding people who could potentially be a soulmate is what I\\'m saying. Right. But if that\\'s her personal preference, so, so it\\'s almost like saying, just say for some reason, I didn\\'t like, like skin women, just say, I didn\\'t like light skin women. And only women I like is dark skin women. That\\'s my personal preference. My personal preference is, hey, I only like light skin women. I mean, I only like dark skin women. Somebody else come along and said, well, you missing out your, your, your soulmate may be a light skin women, a light skin woman. And I\\'m like, I, I just told you it\\'s not my personal preference. I don\\'t, you know, so, so I, so I think what we\\'re like, you can, you can be, you can, you\\'re fine to have your own personal preference as who cares, that\\'s your personal preference. I\\'m just a little bit more open minded than that. I\\'m not going to lock anybody out because of this, because of that. What I\\'m saying is you, you, you, you are potentially excluding someone who may make you happy for the rest of your life. It\\'s because they\\'re not like quote unquote CEO. Like for me, I don\\'t think she\\'s someone said they got to be a CEO. That\\'s what she said. She was, she wants a CEO entrepreneur, my type of person. That\\'s what she can do. I don\\'t have to be a, well, you are, you\\'re a CEO of your own, but yes, I don\\'t know. I kind of understood what she said. Like, okay. So because she is an entrepreneur. I can totally see where someone will want to be with someone who has to go through that same struggle as she went through to get to where she is. I can see that. Like I could see her feeling like this person who does work a nine to five or a 10 to six can\\'t understand why I\\'m up all nights in the morning working. I\\'m sure they can. I\\'m like you\\'re saying it\\'s never happened with somebody couldn\\'t. I\\'m sure. I\\'m sure it has, but I\\'m sure there will be people who understand as well. I don\\'t like, like, again, you\\'re judging, you\\'re judging the potential of someone to understand something based on the type of job they have. It\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, what if she\\'s already been through that situation? It sounds, it sounds ignorant as hell to me. You know, like how can you say that someone who works a normal job won\\'t understand that. Maybe they\\'ll just kiss you on the cheek and go to sleep so they can get up and go to work in the morning. You understand what I\\'m saying? Like you just, you, you, there are some sensible and light and understanding people in the world who happen to work nine to five jobs. So what if through her, what if through her experiences that hasn\\'t been the case and then at the, at some point she\\'s like, you know what, I\\'m just not going to deal with that anymore. I\\'m going to, I\\'m going to be with this type of, but what if she gets, what if she gets those, uh, entrepreneur, CEO types and they don\\'t do them, but you\\'re the wrong. That can happen as well. So I mean, you can always have, uh, both sides, no matter what direction you\\'re going on. I\\'m saying is to exclude a person based on them being a nine to five worker, it\\'s kind of goofy. It\\'s kind of silly to me. Um, but that\\'s her problem. I think she can, she can, she can do as she pleases, um, me personally, if I was in that position where I had my own business, I don\\'t know if I want another business owner to be my partner. I might want somebody who is a little bit, a little bit, you might be missing out on a soulmate. Yeah. I\\'m, I\\'m just, I\\'m giving you a, uh, I\\'m just throwing something out here to you. I may, I may potentially want someone who is removed from what I\\'m doing so that I can balance my life out a little bit, but never did I just say I don\\'t want somebody who I said, maybe, you know, maybe is leaving the door open. You know, I\\'m, I\\'m not going to close that door. I think here\\'s the thing. I just think people should be allowed to work. She is allowed to, she is allowed to screw me though. Like she can keep people, people are also allowed to comment on it because you put it out there. Right. Right. So, you know, you can\\'t have it both ways. Right. I just, I think she\\'s getting a lot of unfair scrutiny, uh, about, about that. And I don\\'t know, man, it seemed like, and I ain\\'t saying you not at all, but I am seeing a lot of butt hurt me and out there because they have a nine to five. Bro, every time a guy come out there and say, I don\\'t like dark skinned women, I don\\'t like that. They get, they get fucking wrecked over the cold. So a woman, I made that analogy. A woman can get raked over the colds for saying this shit too. Okay. We, we going to be fair across, across all sides. And I don\\'t even like, but here\\'s the thing, fair is fair with me. I don\\'t like that at all. I\\'m not fighting that one. I\\'m going to line sometimes like, you know, like what? Let a person like what they like, like, you can like, bro, it\\'s not what you do is how do you do it. It\\'s not what you do is how you do it. If you, if you, if you remember that she talked down to people with nine of five, I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t, I just watched a small snippet of what I saw from what I saw. Yeah. From what I saw, it wasn\\'t something egregious or anything like that. But you know, sometimes when you, when you, I think, you know, people get into the habit of speaking so freely that they don\\'t deliver their message in a palatable way. Not that, not that it has to be in a palatable way, but you got to have that, that thick skin to deal with what\\'s going to come. You just got to be cognizant of what you\\'re putting out there. Right. If, if you like Trump and you just don\\'t care what people say, you just going to lie and fight back anyway, then they go out there and say whatever you want to say, that\\'s what he does. But you know, of course there\\'s going to be some people who say you, you shouldn\\'t exclude. I just don\\'t think it\\'s wise, but you know, she\\'s free to have her own preferences and opinions. You know, I\\'m not, I\\'m not going to try and change her opinion. You\\'re right. You\\'re right in the sense that if she put it out there, you, especially when you\\'re, when you know, I think like I say, even though I think a lot of it\\'s unfair, because it\\'s just a personal preference. When you have a perfect, I wouldn\\'t want nobody. I wouldn\\'t want nobody coming at me because I, it, it, like if I say it\\'s something like I think Jermaine Dupree, he was, what did he say? He said he said something one time that with the female, he, when he said the female rappers all come, are coming across as strippers or or something like that, like they need to rap about something else. I forget the exact quote, maybe a year ago. He said, oh, he said, I didn\\'t realize you\\'re, you\\'re Jermaine Dupree, you give, you give it what I\\'m saying. So you just can\\'t be throwing stuff like that out there. You\\'re going to get a backlash and somebody going to always have an opinion because you got to understand, you got to understand because people hold certain, uh, influencers and famous people or rich people, uh, they hold them to a higher regard. So when you say something that is potentially or has the appearance of speaking down to people, you\\'re going to get some backlash. It is what it is. But she\\'s, she\\'s free to not want to nine to five, man. She don\\'t have to go get somebody that\\'s working at Burger King or anything like that. Should she be free to say it? Yeah. Just like any, just like anything we say here, somebody may disagree with it or make a response. Go ahead. Go ahead. That\\'s what it is. Put it in the comments. Disagree. I want to know. I want to know what you disagree with. But believe me, I\\'m not going to lose my sleep or I won\\'t either unless it\\'s the, uh, teal ruckus, teal ruckus. Oh my God. I would love for teal ruckus to leave us a comment. Go ahead, bro. No, but, um, no, I mean, I think like, like I said, I, I thought, I thought the criticism was a little off. I mean, and I don\\'t know, I don\\'t work in nine to five, I should, but I don\\'t. I don\\'t know, man, um, that\\'s crazy. But I\\'m done, man. That\\'s all I got. Oh, yeah. That\\'s all I got. You got something? Ooh. Came in quick with that. I\\'d rather want to go to sleep or get on that. What happened to now booty? All right. We not getting off to you, but on now booty. There we go.

Right right right right yeah Get that fair opportunity definitely let let us get in the interest of me of course you don\\'t expect to Let us bombarded right don\\'t put a disadvantage right right right off the gate Yeah, I\\'m the gate Let me not get selected because I fucked up because I ain\\'t right right right now Yeah, we like one person black person Because like even with the dispensaries and other things they would have like a mandatory amount of minorities that have to have a license right Right anytime you put up we got to have 10% I feel like they gonna get it right at their 10% right at the end right 9.99 Right right right right right right right Magic we was gonna work right right we get one oh we gonna get everybody else on teach you the game I\\'m like this I gotta be but like even with that like the way I look at things man like I\\'ve always looked at things I\\'m a I\\'m just a go against the grain like Like walk on an unbeaten path like dude anyway, so I never look at things like you know You don\\'t have access to it. You just got to find a creative way to get that access You know I\\'m saying and like and that\\'s what it is You got to be smarter than like the system that they\\'re gonna put in front of you You know saying you know that system you know saying like what can what\\'s the counter punch to that though? Like you know Since all you find that angle and you still penetrate and you\\'re still getting the same benefit It may you may have to work a little bit harder, but if you ain\\'t no stranger to hard work It ain\\'t nothing just another day, you know so you just wake up just another day So that\\'s like that\\'s just what it is So I still like I encourage everybody like you know if you really want to get into this industry like bottom line flat out Like just just just do it like straight up like like bottom line flat I could like we can we could think of excuses a thousand excuses right but not even look at the cannabis industry Look at any industry right you know saying like how do you penetrate any industry is it easy for? African-Americans in any industry to penetrate right you know sense So you got to look at that like this ain\\'t no different you know this deal business You know I\\'m saying so so okay So how do you now counter something and be able to get in there? But just like you just got to be a little bit more creative You know I\\'m saying and it works, you know and it works, but be persistent But it\\'s just like it is what that look that\\'s people\\'s a big issue right there Persistent and some consistency. Yeah, you\\'ll try it a flock. Yeah Oh, that was a long time man. It\\'s ain\\'t for me. You know, okay, okay This okay that approach didn\\'t work right what I need to do differently who I need to talk to my right what moves Can I make everything it\\'s like want you truly believe in your mind that that shit gonna happen? Oh, yeah, it\\'s gonna happen and that\\'s gonna stop it and it has to happen for everybody right who has made it successful That\\'s the only difference between them being rich and you not getting to where you want is right really believing themselves I\\'m sleeping in cars to do that. Oh, yeah We\\'re more money than they can count right right right yeah, like look at the Tyler Perry story You know, we got we got multiple examples like just their hard work that grit, you know I\\'m saying you got to have it like people ask me all the time is like an entrepreneur a successful entrepreneur Are they born or are they made you know honestly man? They born like it\\'s something that you got to have in some deep deep deep and I mean like in the pit in a core That you built out of cuz like most people man this row is a hard row If it\\'s not personal stuff that\\'s getting at you you got layers of personal stuff, right? Then you got layers of business stuff right that\\'s all attacking, you know So you have to really be like just you just really have to believe in yourself Right and you and it\\'s like cuz I don\\'t hurt people be like man like brah I believe you bro do that shit you you can make this shit happen a long time Right, right, but it didn\\'t click into a year So my breath Any means necessary, right and I solve the progress in the year I\\'m like, I mean I wasn\\'t trying before when getting actually trying look what the happen right now if I keep trying It\\'s like it\\'s like it\\'s it\\'s so funny because people think it\\'s like a secret like to success But it\\'s really not it\\'s really not like I mean like you just have to keep working like everything is a bill So the first thing that you do yeah, you might only get two or three people to look at you Right, but that\\'s two or three people that you didn\\'t have a look at you at first Yeah And then like that second time you do it you might get six You know I\\'m saying are you might get one but guess what you\\'re being consistent So you have to keep on following up keep on following up and keep on following up You know how much crap people gave us when we dropped our school that was like oh you teach me I grow cannabis people can go online to do that. Yeah, guess what? Mm-hmm people can go online for a whole lot of stuff right a whole but they still pay that why you think Right right right so like what you can you can you can go online to learn anything right But you still have Universities and schools and teaching everything out there right so it was like a lot of that but still like it was just like I Don\\'t care like I know okay if you feel that way, you\\'re not my client. You\\'re not my customer Yes, I\\'ll like just don\\'t take the class. Okay, you know I\\'m saying so and uh, but we just keep you know We just keep like that\\'s my thing though like I\\'m really I\\'m a I\\'m really like a focus like laser focus, dude So I don\\'t see anything except the the end game and like the success behind it So all the the haze that I call it. I don\\'t even see it like I mean, you know like you could you could hear it You could hear the chatter, but you know it don\\'t it don\\'t penetrate because you know, you know, you know where you\\'re going You have to be that way though like every day is gonna be something Something you know saying that\\'s gonna be getting at you like causing self doubt like are you good enough? Are you smart enough? Are you fast enough? You got enough money for this like it\\'s always gonna be something like in the back of your mind And if you and if you fall victim of those thoughts guess what you won\\'t be successful But you just got to keep on pushing through and like even if you don\\'t have whatever it is figure out a way to get it You know, like figure out a way. It\\'s a win. If you got the win, there\\'s a way to make that Definitely definitely definitely all you so look y\\'all Hi, y\\'all been kind of holding up there this past week Everything just going from zero to a hundred really one to zero because right about 50 right It\\'s right right so I mean, I know like yesterday I couldn\\'t deal with people that work. I ain\\'t fly me a bother And shout out to my company like the job I work for there are wonderful because they sent out a email pretty much saying like, uh We all need to be together to be you know unity, but Y\\'all need to put your focus on your right Right, that\\'s the one some feeling right that they didn\\'t gave us an extra mandatory Company while holiday off. Oh wow 22nd. It\\'s for everybody that\\'s strong That is just like hey y\\'all need to you know, you don\\'t have to wait to this day We encourage you if you need to take a day off do that I send my lead and matches like look a lot of this shit got me frustrated these people talking to me on the phone Right, I want to go off right and then later I was talking to just put me there And I\\'m like, you know what I know I knew my move was this before I came to work But I still just try to muster through it, but I told him that he\\'s like man. I understand it\\'s a lot going on Put the requesting and I send the message to make sure they\\'ll go against you right Now I get an email saying, hey, you don\\'t got no unplanned absence against you Enjoy the rest of your day and take care of yourself Hey, that\\'s fresh right there. That\\'s something at all Don\\'t say anything. I\\'ve been noticing my feet people are like, I\\'m just so surprised my job is not saying anything Right, that\\'s what I\\'m saying. Right. That\\'s what I\\'m saying. You know, acting as if there\\'s nothing going on Like it ain\\'t nothing happening right? I\\'m proud it\\'s not burning down right? Right, right. Right. But it\\'s so it\\'s so wild that um, this is the topic So this week 99 years ago this week, um, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Black Wall Street That was the end of that race riot where about 300 Black lives were lost in the district where they couldn\\'t depend on other people I talk about this well before now. I\\'ll talk about this almost every week it feels like But um, they survived because they couldn\\'t depend on anybody else across the railroad tracks Right. They had to depend on each other. Um, but because they were Black and successful You know, the hate came through and um, they were, you know, firing down to the ground, etc But as this is happening, I can\\'t help but to think about 99 years ago This week we were facing See you burning down You know what I\\'m saying? This same type of hatred 99 years ago And it\\'s ago and we still feeling the wrath right now I ain\\'t feeling like it was no Declining that shit at all and the part people I\\'ll be feeling bad for are people that\\'s in that 60-70 range because it was like damn I live through this as a kid right going through segregation at school Right dealing with this in the full capacity of your face and just for it to come full circle all over again It\\'s like I\\'ll be damn. Yeah Think about this perspective too, right? Because we oftentimes think about the racism that our Previous generations have experienced or whatever we\\'ve experienced our own our racism that\\'s for faith But um, I was talking to my councilwoman the other day about this how the other night when they were looting It was mostly kids, you know, I was saying when I would see the live streams when I say kids I mean 17 About bottle liquor. I\\'m right. I mean 80% of them it has to be right in the crowds And so anytime we organize I\\'m I\\'ve been in Ferguson for about five years So when I moved to Ferguson three months before the uprising I\\'ve been boosted around every since but um now it\\'s like It\\'s the same type of perpetuated things over and over and over with reactionary people But what do we do now? And I think it\\'s the young people right because we\\'re not including them in any other organizing processes a lot of times Um, they\\'re coming out their protest during the day, but then when nightfall comes there\\'s no guiding You know, they hurt they live through my ground. A lot of them were 12 13 during that time 14 Right and experiencing that and has to grow up for the past six years Right now they made it. Right now they hurt. They don\\'t know the police officers that was giving our baseball course Exactly exactly exactly You know what I\\'m saying? It\\'s like it\\'s about the young people there\\'s been no call to action Um for just young people like I would love to see that if anybody out there listening or whatever would like to put something together along those sorts But we could say hey, I\\'m saying I\\'m thinking 500 young people. I see a whole crowd of them Right, right. Right. Connects on see how they feeling and include them in a Right. They got a voice. This is not saying don\\'t protest. This is not Burn that shit to the ground. You say hey, okay, right? No one should have lost their life and I\\'m gonna stand on it. I don\\'t care Especially not an elderly black man. Yeah, while we are out here riding Destructive all of this stuff is a part of protesting period. Yeah, so I just feel like we got to connect to the young people Right. Right. Right. I just behaved my only thing with Riding because I\\'m off for that like me and my mom was talking about it. She was like Biring that shit. But just don\\'t do it. You just like you don\\'t Eat you don\\'t shit where you eat. Right. Why would you burn a grocery store or some shit down in your neighborhood? Right. And now you got to drive to the name Right. You want to go to now tomorrow when you wake up and you want some milk Your backyard is like if I\\'m gonna mess up some I\\'m gonna mess up the area where I know I\\'m not going to I\\'m gonna mess up the area. So where\\'s all right bring y\\'all ass either to us to get something You\\'re gonna have to go far out your way, right to go do it So the choice is yours at this point and actually if you look at it like on an economic standpoint Like if you burn up your own city like in it and if it\\'s like an impoverished area from the jump They really don\\'t give two shit. They don\\'t they want to do this Like it like so it won\\'t get it won\\'t get that impact But if you go like how they doing it like they\\'re going like to rodeo drive now That\\'s like oh we got a problem like they\\'re gonna they\\'re gonna cause it\\'s the money Exactly you have to have it if you\\'re gonna do it make it have an impact, you know saying a little strategy behind it They just moving off emotion right right right. Hey, but you know what it\\'s important to make this distinction too Because a lot of times I\\'ve been seeing hearing people say, you know the protest is and pro and they make a distinction what\\'s happening At that point they don\\'t consider that um organized the protest Right those are people who are pursuing it Yeah, and you can tell though, right They don\\'t show up for no people Pro-taste They kick it all day drunk They\\'re like, let\\'s go turn that right right right That\\'s right, right, right So those are I mean even though this disruption is a part of the protest process That is an isolated thing for individuals who want to be acting like that and a lot of them young Which is like it circles back to me. Um, they need our guidance And we have a shift to do it right I just want to try to throw it up and though Yeah, they\\'re walking around AK-47 I got AK-47 he do too, he\\'s 16 Right, right, right You know what I\\'m saying like it\\'s Yeah, that\\'s what we definitely are looking for now And then another thing they don\\'t have cole Like if you think about it like the younger generation is like, you know, you you always respect that the OGs These cats killing OGs like they don\\'t care about shit Yeah, like you know what I\\'m saying A lot of them don\\'t care about themselves Right, so if you don\\'t care about yourself, how can I expect you to care about my life Right, right, right And if you\\'re if the people that\\'s raised you don\\'t give a damn about you That\\'s why you don\\'t care about yourself Right Then I can\\'t It ain\\'t nothing yet It ain\\'t nothing yet That\\'s why I don\\'t argue with a lot of them I\\'ll be seeing them maybe mugging I\\'m like, you got it, LeBron I\\'m not gonna be here Now if you want to sit down and talk That\\'s cool, but I\\'m like you bumping into me It\\'s not gonna cause me a reaction Right, right, right My bad, you did You wanted me to react so you could turn up Now you confused Right, right, right Because I\\'m like, my bad LeBron, you good like I\\'m gonna check on you Yeah Cool, like I\\'m not gonna be like Yeah I\\'m like, all right man, what you good Right Don\\'t ask me I agree, bro Right, right, right You\\'re not mad at me And that\\'s what you gotta realize You\\'re not mad at me Right, right The people before it I don\\'t know for your mama Your daddy and you don\\'t And they really not with talking to somebody about their shit Right So how they gonna get that out You let one of them lick your shit down And talk and really tell their feelings before the end of the day Yeah They gonna be crying You gonna be crying For sure Everybody gonna be trying to figure out what\\'s going on For sure And it\\'s like, you just needed to talk to somebody You need somebody to show you like, I do care despite what you\\'re doing Right, right They so used to them messing up And everybody started writing them off Yeah They already written off out the gate being born black Right Then you got your school system writing you off Because they just looking at the numbers for schools They\\'re not worried about your education Yeah, not for real for real Then you got the criminal system hoping you fuck up So they can just put you in their system Right They\\'re just like, right, right Nobody care about me Why should I care about me Often they go out here in rec havoc That\\'s how they use them When they go to Chicago You don\\'t wanna get in tune with them Right, are you even worth it? It\\'s not my life or what you want, man You don\\'t ride me with you Right, right I\\'m gonna turn this phone off by the time you get far enough It\\'s something in it Exactly I got enough I\\'m gonna give you a fake daddy car Right You\\'re not gonna take the whole wallet Right And then you\\'re still out here struggling Right Right Right That\\'s what\\'s the money Like, I ain\\'t got it like that It hasn\\'t proved anything You know what I\\'m saying? Come on, man Like, my thing is like with that With those examples of like that particular generation That particular demographic Like, how do you really touch them? Like, really Cause you can\\'t approach them Like, that\\'s the ways that\\'s been happening Because obviously it don\\'t work Right, how do you really touch them?

Yeah Yeah, yeah It\\'s all you want, yeah Yeah, yeah Yeah Yeah Inspiration Right, so the climate here We\\'re newer in the industry As far as getting medical marijuana legalized And of course the fight continues For the end of the prohibition on marijuana And everything But to go there And see I mean of course they\\'ve been legal longer And they\\'ve had opportunities to be established But a lot of the things that I And gold said But talk SEL has an Academy Education Collective has Is to be able to do that You know, I want to be able to Educate the community on the loophole So to speak with any system That allows us this legal trap You know That allows us the ability Like we talk about every week to grow Consume, possess Be a caregiver And all of those things So the trip was amazing, amazing I got to visit the cookie store While I was there I got to meet a cookie store Cultivator Who grows for the cookie store And walks up in the area And just make sure that I was connecting to the right people While I was there Cookie store was dope, man I even looked in the ceiling And the ceiling was like sparkling I went to the one in LA that got looted Okay, yeah, oh I went to the one in LA They got looted You know what I\\'m saying? So I\\'m looking up and it\\'s going It\\'s a line outside They\\'re moving everything smooth The energy is great in there Oh, that means you Everything is clean I\\'m like, oh, that would be dope to franchise And bring back home But it was just crazy When I got back home and touched down George Floyd had been killed And it was like, you know, back home Right Like you talked about earlier Like you go somewhere else And you look in the climate It\\'s different The images, different Everybody, you know, smoking is free Yeah, happy And you come home I\\'m like, I came home today And then a few days later What happened, they looted the cookie store I didn\\'t in LA I said, dang, did I strike what you said now? I thought I got my cookies Then I got my cookies It\\'s a whole thing That got special value now Yeah, you\\'re right This was just a loot edition You know what I\\'m saying? Selling this shit by, how did that happen? It\\'s a loot pack So I know It\\'s a loot pack But the cereal milk is a dog shrine Because it is one of the few shrines That is perfectly balanced So when I read about it, it\\'s a 50/50 shrine So 50% sotiva 50% indica Very, very rare So when you smoke it, you feel that balance Like you said, you are And I feel more If it happens, you like it Like a wax Yeah, I\\'m a villain Yeah Really, really, really amazing shrine Berry smelled A whole night smelling like he smelling the ball of a loot Yeah, that\\'s true That\\'s legit That\\'s what I like When I\\'ll be smelling weed That I\\'m knowing My figure ain\\'t putting like Little shit on there They basically do that shit back in the day Oh, this game is so bad Why are y\\'all paying? I\\'m like niggas You just made all the milk Selling them in the gas station Little droplets Make your weed smell different Niggas is all heard from that So I\\'m like, bro, but this shit, bro But it smells like my type of weed Right, right, right, right I\\'ll be in line with like I\\'m like just that good authentic Well, that\\'s why I can\\'t wait to start trying to go to these places Cause I\\'ve never been to Cali, Denver Vegas And then just going to dispensary It\\'s an experience Well, they\\'re not trying to fucking bust your head Right, right And go crazy Missouri has some of the best laws as far as taxes Yeah, they do Everything They do shots off of that We have some of the best Even home cultivation within all of our things But particularly the taxes We\\'re not feeling it yet Because our dispensaries are not open But that\\'s the push to get people legal Right, because we are only medical That we\\'re not a recreational place So when them dispensaries open It\\'s you got to have a y\\'all court Right, right It\\'s not like in Illinois how Anybody can just come Whatever, just don\\'t bring it off of state lines You good No, you won\\'t be able to have access Exactly, exactly It\\'s just I think like when it comes to the whole court thing Like if you if you\\'re a consumer, cannabis Like it just makes sense to have a court nowadays Like I mean, I ride around with cannabis All the time, right So it\\'s just like being able to have that court On you and being able to just You feel like some sense of protection You know what I\\'m saying? Like if you even though like the laws on You know cannabis and stuff are getting You know getting less and less You know, hardcore But at the same time I just don\\'t want nothing to deflect them My pretty record You know what I\\'m saying? So so yeah Just being able to have that court As a sense of protection Like it\\'s just it just it just makes sense to me Yeah, you know what I\\'m saying? Definitely Y\\'all want one I\\'m living in Illinois So I ain\\'t really looking for a beer one year Because they got to do the most to try to get a car Over there From what I saw The name is easy It\\'s a high degree Right It cost more money I heard it cost like 500 bucks all together Yeah, it\\'s like you got to pay the $100 Application fee You got to do it I see the doctor do it I\\'m like, \"Ronda, you want one?\" I\\'m like, \"What?\" What is that? Yeah, yeah If I\\'m gonna get a car I\\'d be asking me, \"Y\\'all gotta have to give me an ailment\" Right I\\'ll be the real ailment, yes Like, \"Shall I go pay 75 hours cross stay in Illinois?\" Y\\'all gonna make me move across Like, \"That shit made me mad\" Yeah, but shout out to the cookie store Even for how they handled it I\\'m gonna wrap it up But this store It was He\\'s a part owner But he\\'s a rapper Turn cannabis enthusiast and business owner And they asked him, \"How did you feel about having your store looted?\" And his response was to perp His response was that No life It\\'s worth more than this stuff Like this stuff is replaceable And that he wanted to make sure that people knew that They were there To speak up and be a voice for Indigenous people People with color And people that have been discriminated against So shout out to them For having a right mindset around about the situation Right Next right It\\'s like, \"Yo, we hit the weed\" Hey, that was my That was my That was my That was my How much we just That\\'s why I would\\'ve been I was right We went up my mouth Anybody y\\'all Thirteen had hit the cookie store Call me three one four Sixteen time I know y\\'all gotta have I mean, I don\\'t think that Are they growing they weed there too? It\\'s a Arkansas Nah Why they think so? What they had What they had What I learned about the Business is they would have straight brokers So even in their dispensaries You would have people that are growing before you And then they\\'ll come see you and be like, \"Hey man, I can see it. You will pay I\\'ll get you around But as low as you can Just like, you don\\'t regularly pay for that Like, yeah What we can be doing here Like, that\\'s the whole thing When I talk about \"Oh man, we can be the plug to the dispensary\" That\\'s a belief It\\'s a way That\\'s a belief That we can grow our own We won\\'t even need a dispensary That\\'ll need us Let me see And that\\'s the way it\\'s gonna go It\\'s the way they keep pushing the bank Right They don\\'t be no big Right That\\'s You know what I\\'m saying? So it\\'s just a way to think about it y\\'all So continue to To support the movement In cannabis and legalizing In cannabis industry And making sure that People of color are included In every step of the way Because they have eaten And kicked our backs And it\\'s with its weed And now it\\'s our time $24 billion on the table Make sure you get your song Let\\'s talk NCL Yeah Let\\'s talk this video Here we go You\\'re just talking about Kicking the song In the video With Zachary Post Man So look We know about you We got to meet you at your class So for our viewers Who have never heard of your brand Your business Just kind of tell them a little About yourself For everything you got going on Alright First and foremost I hate talking about myself But I\\'ll do it anyway So So I\\'m the president of a non-profit Organization called Elite Home Girls Academy The first candidate school In St. Louis We\\'re actually in Missouri And we have a range of classes From cultivation To stock investing To cooking with cannabis It\\'s another one I forget it But we\\'re constantly Rolling out new curriculum And actually I have like Four different classes And the crates that we\\'re going to be Opening up pretty soon But of course the COVID-19 Pretty much Through a monkey wrenching a program And like the Roll-offs of those But they still And the crates So we\\'re going to be Breaking them out here So we\\'re feeling like You know the temperament Out here is kind of ready for it But yeah So that\\'s kind of what What we do At Elite Home Girls Academy Okay Okay so look What inspired you to get into the Cannabis industry Man it was like Uh How do I It\\'s a I have a weird story I won\\'t go I won\\'t go all the way into it But It was just I\\'ve always had a Fixation with marijuana Ever since like a child I tried to go in my first plant When I was 12 Right My first candidate was playing When I was 12 But I have 12 brothers and sisters So that was like Didn\\'t quite As soon as they sprouted I got told on to my own Whitney You know what I\\'m saying Like So So they didn\\'t quite work out So it like started then And then of course like I got You know to the point where I had to Be quote unquote responsible So I kind of put the marijuana down And you know Story doing my thing And became a pharmacy technician And did a lot of different things But I\\'ve always was drawn to cannabis Right I wasn\\'t really consuming at that time Right Because of the drug test And so on and so forth But I\\'ve always like Was fixing it Fixated on it Like I just like Smell it and Smell it and Smell it and Smell it and I was like Let me smell it You know what I\\'m saying or whatever But then a transition Happened in my life Where I was transitioning out of Pharmacy And becoming like Um Mortgage broker But with a mortgage broker Like you kind of like Get your own schedule So and I didn\\'t have a book of business Like I didn\\'t have any like a lot of clients So I needed to make some money And my homie had an uncle That came from Celineas, California Was an outdoor grower But he was coming to Came to Vegas to actually Cultivate in Vegas And just out of luck You know what I\\'m saying Just I met the guy You know what I\\'m saying And it was all like really like Preliminary Every stuff at first Like really nothing serious Like I went trying to Pursue a career in it But then an opportunity came for me To get a job there As a tremor You know that\\'s where it all started As a tremor right And uh yeah Tremor sucks And it\\'s like the worst position of half Wow, I bought somebody to do it I was like yeah Yeah like this muscle here in your thumb It gets super big Like it\\'s super strong Just because like It\\'s uh it\\'s a very painful job But you know it was just like Kind of like If it did what it needed to do Like I was making like 17 But when I was making At that time it was like 14 bucks As a tremor But then I got promoted to a Cultivation assistant And then that\\'s when I actually start To really get the path Like I start to learn how to grow it And really it\\'s funny Like I wasn\\'t even like Like I guess holding the information I would just do it as a job And then one day I just like say you know what I\\'m gonna really start trying to Like seriously learn how to do this Right so That I started asking the right questions And just being around Like working extra And like just And then of course going Going to the crib I had my own to grow my garage at that point And trying to grow in the Las Vegas garage It\\'s ridiculous Like man it\\'s Talk about challenges Wow Yeah my first harvest was trash It was horrible But I got through it right And um But it\\'s like I\\'m a perfectionist type dude And I feel like No matter what I do I can get good at it And I just kind of good I can get great at a lot of stuff If I have enough time and enough leeway And so that\\'s why So I just kind of made that my thing And uh And just went hard at it And that\\'s what kind of got me Into the industry Initially just pretty much like Kind of looked up on a position And created that real deep down passion For what it is now Yes thanks for being a trend setter Oh thank you Thank you So um we we hinted on how hard it is You know for us Well I\\'m not gonna say whole I\\'m gonna say it\\'s a little more challenging But um this advantage is that You feel African-American people Have in the cannabis industry Yeah I would say first and foremost Is access to capital You know like if you look at it That\\'s what kills almost anything If you don\\'t have the start of funds to do it It\\'s nothing You know and so you look at the networks And like just like how Just getting capital in anything You try to get finance a house You know what I\\'m saying Like how many black homeowners you know Like it\\'s the same thing right Like you gotta Be able to put yourself in a position Able to get access to that capital And then most of it If they don\\'t know like the rules of the game It\\'s really hard for them to get That access to the capital So I would say first and foremost That\\'s what it is Because they can have the knowledge They can have Some of the resources But the The can come down to capital Like bottom line flat out You know Do you have any advice? For anyone in that area? Yeah sure do Um I would say you really have to be vigilant And be willing to I look at it like this You know 50% of a lot Is 50% of a lot 100% of zero Is 100% zero So you have to be willing to You know make those deals You know what I\\'m saying? Partner with people And you know sometimes Sacrifice You know just to get established Like if you look at like The rap game Okay you get signed to a big label To build your brand right You\\'re contracting with that big With that big label But you still have that brand that\\'s built So now you can really start doing your own stuff Right so It\\'s the same way You get to the point where you build You build a relationship with Whoever you have to You know what I\\'m saying You work that angle And because that angle is going to Bring you so many more resources That you didn\\'t have access to anyway At the beginning So now you start to build Your own book of business Your own network chain And you start to rely on that And you build your own thing on the side Like it\\'s not a fast process That\\'s the thing about it None of this stuff is fast You know so people like okay If like you know we\\'re in the microwave era So if I can\\'t have my dispensary tomorrow I don\\'t want it You know what I\\'m saying like Nah no you\\'re gonna have to fight tooth and nail And even when you get it Like getting it will be Actually when you get it You\\'re gonna realize that Getting it was the easiest part Keeping that sucker open Is gonna be the hard part right So be careful what you wish for You know so And that\\'s what it is like So I would just say You know just If you know that\\'s what you want to do That\\'s what you want to pursue Start pursuing it And start Doing bit dealing with the people that you see Or actually moving and being productive You know and start to really Show it so so so so some sense of value That they want to deal with you And not like look for like not And not come to it like with Nothing to bring into the table Versus hey I got something to bring to the table That\\'s strong You already got something that\\'s strong Let\\'s collaborate And now let\\'s let\\'s work off each other Let\\'s cross promote Let\\'s really build something You know so that\\'s what I would say Like don\\'t get discouraged Like because you\\'re gonna hear a lot of No it\\'s like about a man You know whatever But you just keep pushing through Because all you need is that one yes You know so Yeah and keep your you know Keep your just credit And all that kind of stuff straight to Like you know you want to You want to be able to be Self-sufficient And self-reliant So things like Understanding business credit And how to actually build it Because personal credit and business Credit are built two totally different ways So if you know that\\'s something that You\\'re going to be doing Start to start looking into that How can I get business financing Because like now you lessen that burden Of like going to somebody and say Hey I need you know 250,000 Where I mean I got 100,000 myself Now I just need 150,000 Now they\\'re like okay Well you got a lot of skin in the game So now they\\'re more willing to work with people So make sure you got something to bring to the table And make sure it\\'s strong You know that\\'s that\\'s what I would say Absolutely I agree So look OpenDood says a two-part question What\\'s your favorite stream of weed to grow And your favorite stream is smoke Okay this favorite stream to grow I would say I recently just looked up on one With this cultivation classic That we were just in And I never grew this stream It was a mystery strain And we didn\\'t even know what it was And we just started growing But it grew so aggressively And like I mean by week three The buzz was already hard Like I was like whoa Like you know what I\\'m saying So that particular strain was named Silver Ghost It\\'s up by the Humboldt Seed Organization And so I would say Right now even though this just happened Right now that\\'s like my favorite stream to grow Like after I figured out what the name of the strain was I went and bought packs of seeds of it You know what I\\'m saying? Were those auto flowers? No Oh that\\'s without old stuff Right Why was it just thinking about how fast you were Playing that? Thank you for sure like that And that was like the fastest plant you ever seen Out of all the streams of the time I\\'m gonna say it\\'s the fastest But it was definitely It wasn\\'t just like the fastest of it It was the structure of the buds It was the terpenes It was just the way that it grew was It was a hardy plant So I would say it pretty much hit all the The things that you look for as a grower It crossed them all off you know Off the line and you know But we kind of had to chop it down early Because of the competition Because we had to submit it at a certain time So we didn\\'t even let it finish like all the way through Right But it still came on to be pretty decent smoke Like we didn\\'t even win the competition I\\'m kind of you know but heard about that But it\\'s all good We placed top five So top five is Okay You know what I\\'m saying? I\\'ll do nothing to get top five though Like you know what I\\'m saying? Like yeah you got fifth place You don\\'t even get a medal for fifth place You get like a ribbon Like you know what I\\'m saying? You don\\'t even get a medal for fifth place Right? You know what I\\'m saying? So yeah it is what it is But this next year you know Next year we\\'re just gonna keep loading up them cannons Like I don\\'t stop So you know what I\\'m saying? Like this is a sport to me You know what I\\'m saying? I love I love cultivating cannabis Like it\\'s taking over my life Actually at this point That\\'s ridiculous But Every day I\\'m seeing you bigger and bigger team I\\'m saying you\\'re a man How\\'s gonna be a team?

      "{'transcript': ' Welcome to Mike\\'s Amen. We\\'re back again, commentators on the culture, debating things that matter and some that don\\'t. Thanks for tuning in. You can follow us on all the socials, Mike\\'s Amen, Instagram, Mike\\'s Amen on Twitter, Mike\\'s X-Men on Facebook, or you can email us at micsmenone@gmail.com. I\\'m Kwebner and today the men behind the Mike\\'s and virtual screens are usual big rocks. And we are fortunate enough to have a new voice in the room and someone will be trying to get on the show for quite a while. Welcome Esther. Welcome. Hello. Hi. Do you want to say a little bit about yourself and what you do? Yes, okay. So my name is Esther and I\\'m a social worker and psychotherapist. I work in mental health services and I also have founded frontline therapists, which is a one-stop shop mental health platform to support people on their mental health journey. And we provide counselling and affordable price right now remotely. And also we provide ebooks and planners to help people manage their mental health. Cool. So that\\'s good work. Yeah. Good work. We\\'ll try and support that as every way we can because I think you\\'re doing a great thing. And it being mental health awareness week got some topics that we thought reflected some of your knowledge and attributes for things that have kind of been cycling amongst us and things that we\\'ve been discussing. And I think the first thing to get into was we were discussing as a group mental health the way it\\'s perceived in the west versus how it\\'s perceived for a lot of us back home. So for those of you who don\\'t know, I\\'m from Ghana, quite these from Nigeria, rocks, it\\'s from kids, and then we\\'re... So yeah, so we have a mix of the Afro-Kai-Bian culture on the on the post-college is great, but it\\'s like the way we see mental health is very different, right? So up until pretty recently, Ghana had like less than 25 psychotherapists registered licensed psychotherapists in the country, right, which is a wild statistic. But then I also think that because of that, people are forced to look at mental health differently. The idea of having breakdowns because of stress, the idea of being bipolar, the idea of feeling overwhelmed in certain places where you hear you could take time to address that, seek counseling, etc. Either due to stigma or due to lack of resources, it\\'s dismissed. Like definitely in Ghana, it\\'s improving, but it\\'s definitely been dismissed a lot in the past. And I wanted to know whether you thought that means that the quality of life people have when regard to mental health is better in those places or whether you think actually addressing it and acknowledging it the way it\\'s done in the western world, the UK, we can take as an example because we will live here, is actually a better approach. So I want to start with you, I\\'ll talk with you next, but see what you thought. Do you know what, when I had an initial idea, I was going to answer the question and as you kind of broke it down, I thought of something else. So you know when you, I don\\'t know if you ever researched that, where\\'s the happiest place or who\\'s got the best quality of life, it\\'s never the UK or the west like overall. It\\'s never. Used to regions or Africa has usually seen. So I think that\\'s important to have that in mind, that best quality of life, when they do research on that and they take an account into everything, it\\'s never the UK and the west. I think there\\'s something to put there in terms of the question that you\\'ve asked. I think we should be careful to compare and contrast things like that. Generally speaking, because then in the question we\\'re basically saying, the question is that we\\'re not a you are saying it, but the question kind of assumes that basically the west deals with it better than anywhere else. And that was every country deals with it the way they need to, the best that they can deal with it and of course it needs to be improvements because every country has different things that they deal with. Then so I think that\\'s important to make. So because we are from the, I guess we\\'re just called the Diaspora, but because we are from Africa, we have affairs of second or third generation at all and the Caribbean, it\\'s obviously important to us because we also do have family back home and we also do have ties back home. So I wouldn\\'t say that we have a better quality of life because only 40 years ago, the UK was very backward in the way they thought of mental health, you know, and even still now, we are only engaging in a conversation in public what the last five to 10 years since social media has come to the fore. But I work in mental health services and I will say that the stigma unfortunately is still there, you know, but I think with Africa particularly, because there\\'s so many other prevailing issues, mental health also compounds it if that makes sense. So the poverty is high, HIV, all of these other things that does happen here, but maybe not in this extremity happens in certain parts of Africa that add in mental health also compounds the issue and because poverty and mental illness is so in inextricably linked and if you have HIV, you\\'re more likely to be depressed, you know, if you are poor and you know poor in Africa is poor, like, you know, it\\'s really poverty and there\\'s no welfare system, you\\'re likely to have mental health issues, however, we know so people good or bad, we\\'ve got we\\'ve got such a resilience that if you talk to a lot of people from other cultures, that\\'s usually one thing they say they really admire about black people in general, that we just got a resilience and we know why because of the thing that we\\'ve gone through. So you see in Nigeria, in Uganda, that somebody can have mental health issues but still somehow function, maybe I guess that\\'s my point, right? That\\'s my point, like you made a really important point there, like I think that you are forced to function in a way that you\\'re not necessarily forced to function outside of that. So that\\'s that mean you are able to craft a better quality of life because you\\'ve got no choice or nothing. If I can jump on the back of that, so as much as you\\'re thinking about crafting out a way of life based on the fact that you\\'re forced to, in my opinion, one of the other things that the question is kind of broached, is almost like, you know, the old adage of is ignorant bliss, because we argue that in the West are sort of superior or inclusive knowledge of all different breakdowns behind sort of psychotherapy and mental well-being, means that we\\'re highlighting the possibilities to people a lot more prominently. So for a lot of your someone like yourself, you\\'ve obviously experienced in it, or just a teenager coming out of school, we\\'re advertising mental health a lot more than we would be doing at my home. So where they\\'re sitting in kind of blissful ignorance, they can actually be going through something and not necessarily have the platforms within that company to help them understand it. Is that actually misfereignal? Is actually then might end up getting through it by not accentuating the fact that they\\'re in a situation? Does that make sense? Yeah, that\\'s it. And there\\'s other things in that. If you have a mental health issue, so you\\'ve got lack of infrastructure anyway, so having a mental health issue is one thing, but if there is nowhere to go or the way you can go, you can\\'t access it, or you\\'ve got to pay for it, and you haven\\'t got no money, then it\\'s like, isn\\'t it better not to know that you have it? Because if you know, oh crap, I\\'ve got a mental health issue, but you can\\'t go and access to the treatment that you need, then having it just stays that you have it. And then, you know, in Africa, that is in every single country, but in Nigeria, you haven\\'t got a welfare system, you have to pay for everything. So if you can\\'t pay for mental health treatment, then what do you do? So people just start along. You don\\'t have the capacity or someone says you just are forced to get on with it. And that\\'s what I say is a good or bad thing. The reason why I say it is not just a bad thing, it\\'s because in society that Africa is in, there\\'s so many other things, the government, the corruption, the fact that there\\'s lack of education, the fact that there\\'s these in spread, there\\'s so many things that can get you so down in the press, whether you\\'ve got a mental health issue or not, that having a mental health issue on top of the things that just made you as a society will mean that you might as well just stop. You know what, there\\'s no point continuing in life. That\\'s what a lot of people would say about home, but you have to, you have to get the generator run. You have to fetch the water. You just have to keep moving because if you don\\'t move, nobody\\'s stopping for you. Whereas in the UK, it\\'s not that things just stop for you, but potentially if you have a breakdown and you lose your job, there is job seekers, there is ESA, there\\'s universal credit. You know, there\\'s a bit of a mattress for you to fall upon that then allows you the space and time to have a breakdown where there is in certain parts of Africa that isn\\'t there. So yes, people have told along and not have those issues. So the people, the 25 psychophopics, where were they trained? That\\'s what I wanted to ask. Were they trained in abroad? That\\'s a good question actually. I haven\\'t got a breakdown of where they were trained, but I mean, I\\'m sure there\\'ll be some kind of mix. I don\\'t know what the breakdown would be, but I was just because of the way medicine is seen across Africa and the way in which things are kind of the way in which people perceive the medical and educational system, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if people went abroad to get a level of education or special they had before. But I\\'m crafty, you\\'re going to say something. Yeah, basically, I mean touching on the point with the 25 doctors for psychotherapy, I think you said. Yeah, that is a low number in any country when there when there\\'s millions of people. It\\'s all relative. I mean, I would say that quality of life or are you people that are happy or not? In some way that Africa, you have a different type of community that maybe helps in that way. That\\'s a very good point. More community centric rather than here where you\\'re kind of on your own. So, mattress to full on, shall we say, or a pillow to cushion the blow. It\\'s very different societies. So here, yeah, you\\'ve got a lot more services or they\\'re ramping up services for mental health, but at the same time, there is that need for it. I\\'m not saying there isn\\'t a need for it in Africa, but I don\\'t think the need for it is as much as it is here. And then there are different things that stress you out in this country. You\\'re talking about the rat race, trying to own a home. Just various things that there is no sense of community here in this country. Yeah, you come together for NHS and cut your hands and stuff. But other than that, I don\\'t really see it in everyday life. I should do in Africa. Or should I say more specifically Nigeria? I guess there could be the argument that having an NHS or a government and a welfare system that we have is a sense of community at the highest level, because people pay their taxes and they contribute to a system that means that those of us who don\\'t really have anything can fall back on something. Whereas, there\\'s different kind of communities back home where it\\'s almost like everyone within that group takes care of their own. Perhaps outside of that group, there\\'s not like an overarching community like feel. So I think when I think about, when I think about the, I guess, well-being and quality of life and mental health point of view, it\\'s kind of difficult to me because I\\'ve kind of got both ways. So I\\'m obviously London, not obviously, but I\\'m London born Ghanaian race. When I say that, I mean in my household growing up as a Ghanaian, it wasn\\'t like I\\'m a Ghanaian who\\'s born in London. I was raised as a Ghanaian full stop. So I raised, raised eating the food, speaking the language. I spoke, I spoke English when I\\'m at school, that\\'s it, that kind of environment. So even the thought process of being stressed about exams, for example, is very much a look, exactly, to happen. You need to do it to be full. So I think it has a result. And as a result, I think it\\'s had a positive impact on me. So, well, you want to say a quality? Right. Looking at the kids here and how they grow up compared to Africa, and you know that the community get involved in the child\\'s life, not in the way that we\\'re still legal to get involved here in the sort of... Yeah, look, there\\'s a, with us, we grow up in that mentality of it takes a village, right? That\\'s the kind of mentality that we adopt. But like, I\\'m sure you will have a lot of structures. Sorry? They have other structures that kind of help with the happiness or the quality of life that you say. You know, a lot of people would love to earn the money here. But when you ask them about where you\\'re going to retire, they\\'re picking those same countries. Yeah, that is true. It\\'s true. It\\'s like here, there was a talk looking into how kids were too stressed, like they had too much homework. Like the idea of trying to talk to like family back home about how kids are too much homework. It would not be you, Ed. Yeah, good. So the society said it\\'s not a post positive and negative. So having a strong family structure is positive. But if you have a strong family structure that doesn\\'t acknowledge mental health, then it could be negative because it would mean that it would be neglected and ignored. And that\\'s the thing that you do find both here, from the African background and also in Africa and the Caribbean is the fact that you do have strong family structures, but with such shame acknowledging because mental illness is seen as a weakness. So if you agree to the weakness, then that is the issue. So you\\'ve got strong families, which is amazing. It is good. If your families don\\'t acknowledge that it\\'s not a weakness, but in that sense, yes, it might be something you need supporting, then it can be quite difficult because you\\'re quite shamed and you just struggle with silence. But then, yeah, that\\'s true. But then it boils down to the fact of what triggers mental illness. Sometimes it\\'s, I think, that you\\'re surrounding. So you could say it\\'s a stressful life living somewhere where you\\'re quite poor and so on. But if it\\'s all you know, and everyone around you\\'s in the same position, and they have a sense of community where they don\\'t steal from each other and things like that, it boils down to what triggers it and here in this country, there\\'s lots of different things that can contribute to mental illness. So just before we wrap up this quick question, what I can see like your eyes have been like switching for like the calls in your head have been turning. Only because the worrying thing that I\\'ve got is the fact that I do think that there is a change happening. If you go back to say, say, Kate, which is the place in Jamaica, I\\'ve gone over the last sort of 15, 20 years, same kids as an island. And I think this is true for all of the Caribbean islands, it\\'s starting to become a little more westernized. And becoming a little more westernized because they\\'re largely following the Americas and more American TV, more American food products technologies. I think that we\\'re starting to see more mental health issues becoming apparent based on the fact that we\\'re starting to pick up on these same stimuluses that we over here have been using, help just stimulate us into mental in our life, to have you normally a mentally classified kind of boxes that we\\'ve been speaking about today? So yeah, I was just seeing a thinking about the fact that there\\'s definitely a transition happening. I think we\\'re not here, we\\'re not here back home. I don\\'t think if we had this conversation in 40 years, we would be saying the same thing. I think we\\'d be saying that it\\'s going to be a lot more parallel in terms of the way in which people are dealing with mental health and how or where they are. Okay, cool. So the next thing I wanted to talk about was the recent fallout surrounding dominant comments. So he\\'s been documented of having broken the lockdown. I mean, I don\\'t know, sometimes I feel like seeing rules is like a bit a bit jacodeo, because they kind of feel like more guidelines, but whatever. Anyway, he broke the government\\'s guidelines. But like now we should treat them like guidelines, basically. You\\'re right. You\\'re right. The time which he was doing, what he was doing, they were rules, right? Now they got that. That\\'s a good point, bro. And he broke them. And it seems like everyone else who has broken these have been removed from the post or lived left or whatever. They\\'ve either pushed or been jumped. I mean, like whatever, it doesn\\'t make it a joke. They\\'ve left their post. And Boris had come out and backed him and said that he\\'s behaved exactly how he should have done, considering his circumstance. But as someone who wills the level of influence that he has and the position that he holds within the office, etc. Do you think he should be removed from his post? I\\'m going to start with you, quite a few. Yeah. So basically, I don\\'t really care about what he did. But from a moral standpoint, yeah, he should, because we\\'ve seen others go to others. I don\\'t know if this may be more, but the Scottish Minister and the scientist guy. Gotti, you\\'re frozen. Maybe we\\'ll start with Gotti. Gotti, you\\'re frozen. Okay, you\\'re frozen a bit. Sorry, continue. Where did you start? Where did I start? You start to start to a scientist guy. Yeah, so basically, Dominic Cummins, he\\'s basically been to five different destinations, four different cities like London twice in the space of 19 days. That\\'s the latest accusation. So he was out on the 5th, 12th, 14th, 19th. And from a moral point, he should just go, basically. But in terms of what he did going in family and stuff, I don\\'t really care because some people would have done it. And if you need to do it, I think that\\'s fine to a certain degree. But because the rules come from his office, but he has to go really. That\\'s really what I\\'ve got to say on that. I\\'m going to almost apologize for agreeing with Crawford, because I hate it when it\\'s happened. Why do you feel the need to apologize? Hey, Quarti, I\\'m a fan believer that when you\\'re right, you\\'re right, for Gotti, when you\\'re right, you\\'re right. Thanks, you\\'re welcome. Yeah, even on the premise that I\\'m not even that bothered about the story, I must admit, I\\'ve kind of let the whole Dominic coming story kind of go above my head somewhat up until very recently, because I think I was just tired of it and coming from a very honest place. I was just tired of the same old nonsense and the same impeded in the same ship and mess. And in the incidents that we spoke about that Crawford just did with the Scottish Minister, I\\'m sorry, I remember her name, but even Nicholas Sturgeon came out and almost back to her credentials at the time, which was being questioned, even though she had clearly done wrong, Nicholas said, \"Don\\'t back to her credentials, back to her ability to do the job, albeit ultimately, she did step down.\" I don\\'t care whether or not he had a legitimate reason or not. And I think, you know, he probably did, but there\\'s perception that if you\\'re going to be the Prime Minister and you\\'re going to be sitting there trying to instigate a particular type of rule into the entire country, when someone clearly breaks those rules, then I think you need to kind of come down a little bit firmer than what he\\'s actually done. So I think he should have stepped down. That would have been honorable things to take it away from Boris to have to make a decision. But I would have liked to see Boris be a little bit stronger on this point, even if it is only as a message that whether or not it\\'s now at a point where we are just kind of using the rules as guidelines or whatever it was like then where they were rules, we should be adhering to this isolation thing. So I\\'m disappointed in Boris. I\\'m disappointed in the government in this particular thing. But yeah, I think it\\'s one of those things that I\\'m just getting a little bit tired of hearing about these same kind of stories now. What\\'s your view on this? I think I\\'m a bit indifferent. I think the difficulty is if it was someone who\\'s they may have thrown into the rules, but coming is a genius. That\\'s what they thought they thought he\\'s a genius. So they won\\'t want to lose him. If they lose him, comes up at the government with Phil, the Brexit, so many things they feel will be impacted. So that\\'s one of the reasons why I think a lot of people are just saying, look, let\\'s just allow it, because in all honesty, to do with his role, just to do with who he is and how good he does for the government that people are debating. If it were somebody else, I\\'m telling you, they would just say, look, okay, sorry, messed up and go, but I think it\\'s because of who he is. And the important role Boris feels and many other people in the cabinet and the government thought that Cummins play right now. So I\\'m indifferent. I guess I do agree if the other two had to go, then maybe he should go. But then I think maybe in the importance of what he does and the fact that I think it was speculative, there\\'s some evidence that\\'s not all for evidence. There\\'s no pictures. I think I was reading on it. What are we basing on? He gave his reasons, did we agree his reasons? And also, who was crying out? Who was actually outraged? I\\'m sure I don\\'t know how I really outraged by this. Is it just the opposition as outraged because they want to cause a blow into the government? So that\\'s my sense and taken it. But I haven\\'t been following it. So maybe people are really angry about it. But I have a lot of opinion. I kind of feel like he\\'s been instrumental so far. So that would be a big blow to the government. But at the same time, I guess what Charlie said, if you want to do like for like, if other people have gone, let them gone. But then why do the others have to go? Do you know what I mean? So many people are breaking it, but I do get their position. But I think in the biggest scheme of things, was it like a major thing that they\\'ve done? Like the other guy, the medical thing was a bit funny, he\\'s sad, but you know, that one was a bit wild. But I saw that for no way. But when you basically, my thing is from what I got the government coming to say, he was with his family, weren\\'t like he was going to a party. He was just talking about with the fact that\\'s the thing. That\\'s the thing. They say that they were childcare related needs. And that\\'s why you can\\'t be seen to give everyone the same kind of punishment because the terms are different. And that\\'s different. Do you know what? I don\\'t think it\\'s really political points because I was listening to LBC. People are phoning in and they\\'re like, no, he\\'s taking the piss. So they\\'re always coming in talking about their experience, what they haven\\'t done. But ultimately, on a moral standpoint, he has to go. And no one in no MP should be in dispenseable. Like everyone has to be able to get final set. It\\'s about how clever or good you are. Because it\\'s funny, I don\\'t really care if what he did because I think millions of other people have done whatever their reasons are. Everyone\\'s got a different reason. But then I think he could have done some other stuff alternative to what he did when you hear about the details. And the Scottish Minister, she only went one place once and went for a walk. And I thought that was a bit much for her to resign off of that. But this... I guess because she had spent so much time talking about the importance of the rule and basically... She had basically put them in place. She had put them in place. And then she broke them. And then she was like, see with him, he\\'s with other kinds of kids and family involved. This is what put them in place. And she was like, let me go take my holiday here at home. Like, you can\\'t spit that. You can\\'t spit it. At least we\\'ve... You can spit it every day, child, child, family, man. But people were allowed to go for a walk, sometimes. The only difference is maybe the... Not to your holiday. It\\'s your second hand for a night with your husband. You went to walk the book. Not to your holiday here, bro. That\\'s like different. That\\'s a different story. But yeah, man, I don\\'t know. I personally think... Like, what? I\\'m actually not that bothered. But I mean, that\\'s your point is, yes, he\\'s in a problem position and they think he\\'s a genius. But the conference lady do well at the moment anyway. So it\\'s like, they could be cut. They\\'re loosing. They might as well be the dice, right? He\\'s looking for the reason why they stay in power. I don\\'t think so. That\\'s me. That\\'s my opinion. I don\\'t think he\\'s the... I don\\'t think he\\'s the Trump card. But I\\'ve been wrong about politics before, man. That could be wrong again. That could be wrong again. Unfortunately, during this lockdown period, the numbers of cases, last time I saw a number of cases or reported cases of domestic violence had increased by 700%. That\\'s a lot. Crazy, crazy stuff. And we were talking amongst ourselves as men about domestic violence and how it could be dealt with. And we got to talking, Esther, about if we were being domestically abused, as in not if we were abusing, because we would never do that. We don\\'t contain that. We don\\'t condone that kind of behavior. But if we as men were being abused by our other hearts, whether it\\'s something that we would go to our parents about, whether it\\'s like a professional only situation, would you be comfortable with those? I want to say from my point of view that if I was being domesticly abused by my wife, girlfriend, fiance, I could talk to my dad about it. In fact, I would talk to my dad about it. I wouldn\\'t talk to my mom about it. I wouldn\\'t because I think the way when my mom set up could be, it would be messier. It would be a messier. But they\\'ve always been about that about it. And I understand, I guess, for some people that talk about toxic masculinity, for some people, they\\'ll talk about just the view of men, chauvinism, brotherhood, all the different types of ways we would look at masculinity. But for me, I think it would be emasculating. And I think that a man in this situation is a place to understand what it feels like to be emasculated, that it would be a woman. And that would be my reason for going to my dad about it. It would be a very difficult one for the Asian, but I would go to him about it. And I think I would talk about it with my parents, well, my parents, but I want to say, like, open up to you guys. If the method of violence, something that would happen to you, would you feel comfortable talking to your parents about it? Do you think it\\'s a good idea? Let\\'s start, do you want to give us a spin on this? I think the question in itself is assumed in a good way, but there is also reality that you are able to even speak to your parents about it, because the whole point of domestic violence is that the person, the perpetrator separates you from your support network, so you\\'re isolated. So for many people, they wouldn\\'t have the opportunity or feel able to even talk to their parents, even if the parents could help, because they\\'re being separated from that. So that\\'s the difficulty for a lot of people. I think for me, I\\'ve only got my mum, so yeah, I\\'ll go to my mum, but I like ourselves, I think she would kill my husband. That would be the fear that you would go crazy. I did not say that. I said, \"I\\'m not going to say that, Bob, I\\'m going to say that.\" I said, \"I know you\\'re going to say it, I haven\\'t got very far.\" That would be amazing if many men or women could speak to their family members, but I think that\\'s unfortunately not the case, because of the domestic abuse, whether it\\'s physical or financially mentally, one of the key things that they do is they separate you from your support network. That\\'s what makes you for a loan, and that\\'s what makes you feel like you have nobody to go to, and you stay in that relationship. Because if you did have a strong support of family network, one, other people could maybe clock what\\'s going on, and two, because of the frequency of conversation and relationship you have with your loved ones, it may not even be able to happen, because as soon as the person does something the first time, you speak to the person, they go, \"Ah, that ain\\'t right.\" But what happens is that they remove that support network from you, so you\\'re by yourself in that situation. Actually, you think, unfortunately, that isn\\'t the case. But if that is the case, I think, yeah, family would be a very good point of call before even professionals per se, because you have somewhere to go to to keep safe, and that\\'s the issue. We have the domestic violence, and as you can see with the rise of it, is that when you\\'re in that situation, you don\\'t have anywhere to go, so you stay, and then that\\'s what continues the circle of abuse. It doesn\\'t have to answer your question, I\\'m actually just trying to say that, unfortunately... You have a lot of context, though. You put a lot out there, and I think, I thought that is a quite comprehensive response. I think there\\'s a lot to go into, but Rob\\'s picked up on something he said, so Rob, what are you going to say? Yeah, no, I was just saying that it adds a lot of context to what you were saying, especially in the whole kind of isolating you from this support network. That\\'s massive, especially considering the question. I mean, trying to answer it as the question was said, there\\'s two things, the domestic abuse and domestic violence, and correct me if I\\'m wrong, yes, the domestic abuse can be bullying, it can be verbal, it can be mental, it covers a lot more, domestic violence is physical, right? I\\'m keeping it simple. Important decision, some important decision, yeah, for sure. So if we\\'re, and this is going to sound really arrogant, so I\\'m here to be honest in it, but... It\\'s here, I mean... We rob a new hands for, chill Paris. Big buck, I just say, is actually interchangeable, is used interchangeably. Okay, cool. Cool. Yeah, because mental and emotional is violent, even though there\\'s not physical, don\\'t make sense. No, I didn\\'t know that, so thank you, cool. Also, good idea, like, you can\\'t touch me, I\\'ve rocks, I\\'ve big rocks. No, but this is the thing, right? You look, I\\'m a 30 man, and if you\\'re asking, right, how would you big rocks deal with domestic violence and this situation? Hold on, wait, hold on, wait. Hold on, hold on, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I can\\'t say it ain\\'t that, and this is... How would you, that\\'s a big rock? Hold on, I\\'m just trying to measure it, we understand the question, yeah? Be fast. You can\\'t do it, I\\'m rockin\\'. You can\\'t do it, I can\\'t do it. This guy, yeah, this guy. I\\'m joking, I\\'m joking, I\\'m joking. No, I think I don\\'t know about your saying, but maybe ask yourself, yeah, you got us about what would rocks do, but then... I\\'m gonna do both, I\\'m gonna do both, I see where you come from, I\\'m gonna do both. I\\'m gonna do both, I\\'m gonna do both. So that\\'s why there\\'s more than one car answer, it\\'s a bit of a layered answer, because if you\\'re coming to me and you\\'re saying, right, big rocks, if you\\'re in a situation where you ought to be in domestically abused tomorrow, or in your next relationship, whatever, the answer is that, really rightly, arrogantly or not. I don\\'t think, based on who I am today, based on my upbringing for the last 30 years, based on the support networks that are here, I don\\'t think that could happen. And I\\'m really, I don\\'t, it maybe sounds a bit cool, because I\\'m sure there are people out there that can say, well, listen, I might have thought that at one point, I look right, I\\'m gonna get that book. I\\'m gonna be arrogant, if that\\'s the case, and say, listen, I don\\'t think there\\'s a woman on this planet that is able to come, and into my life now, based on who I am, where I am, and start domestically abusing me to the point where I feel like I\\'m a victim. That\\'s the initial perspective. And I think if there was a situation where that happened, especially if it was more mental, then yeah, I think I could see myself being in a situation where mentally, because mentally, physically not. I\\'m not gonna be in a situation where someone\\'s going to domestically abuse me physically. No, but mentally, that was gonna happen. Then I could see a situation where maybe I would reach out to my sister or my father to try and have a conversation around how best to build with this, how best to tackle this situation. And I\\'m lucky that I have that support network where that could happen. But like Crafty said, I think in the circumstance, you\\'ve got to kind of take yourself and what\\'s out of the equation, because I\\'m sure there are people that think the same way I feel now, but are in a situation. So you\\'ve got to believe that wherever it\\'s over time, or wherever it\\'s based on layers, or wherever it\\'s based on maybe there\\'s a knock to yours or my confidence, something that happens in my life, that makes me that same big rock that I have now. And then someone comes into my life who\\'s able to take advantage of that. It mightn\\'t happen in a time, it wouldn\\'t happen in a day, but it happened in a time and it slowly degrade me down to a point where somebody could come and domestically abuse me and physically and potentially abuse me. And in that instance, it would probably be very hard. And I could see myself struggling if my confidence is low, so then reach out to my family and have that kind of conversation. And it\\'s got nothing to do with my family, my family is the best in the world, but you try and put yourself in a different mindset. Of course. Of course. How people call that could be. And I get it. For me, if you get asked a question about big rocks, that couldn\\'t happen right now. And that couldn\\'t happen anytime soon. And it would be, you take a look, you take a look. So I don\\'t know if that answers the question, but... No, I mean, it answers the question. It answers the question that you said that you find it difficult to reach out to your family, your parents, I know you\\'re close to your sister, like you made that clear, that you find that difficult. So like, no, you want to do a question. So, Kratty, what do you think? I\\'m going to have to go with always seek professional help, because I can\\'t see myself going to my dad or my mum and asking them for help in that situation. One, maybe... Let me say ask him for help. Sorry, let me just... Let me just... I can wait. Yeah, that will... Well, I guess you expect your family to give you advice, right? But would you feel comfortable talking to them about it? Yeah, so... I don\\'t think I\\'ll feel comfortable because I almost can predict what their reaction would be or what they might say, how they might go about trying to deal with it. Yeah. And that doesn\\'t, or wouldn\\'t, give me or inspire me with confidence, not to say they\\'re bad parents, but this just doesn\\'t seem like something that they would be able to deal with in the best way. I can\\'t really explain it, but you know your parents, and you know what they\\'re good at, what they\\'re not good at in certain ways. So yeah, I\\'d say you\\'d have to go and seek professional help. And I echo what Rocky was saying basically in terms of... I can\\'t... If you\\'re asking me the question, I can\\'t see it happening until like Laura, unless something not to my confidence or over a time period, it gets to that point. But yeah, I don\\'t think parents is a good way to go, especially if they\\'re from the older generation, because whatever solutions they might come up with might be illegal in the eyes of the law. Right? Yeah. But ultimately, yeah, you... I don\\'t think they\\'re... You can rely on them for safe space and for help in that kind of physical way. But in terms of helping you mentally and knowing what\\'s best to do, then seek professional help. But that\\'s the thing, Charlie, he\\'s going to say. I\\'m going to ask a question, Esther. Okay, go on. Let\\'s say how important does the type of... I\\'m sorry, I\\'m asking you because you\\'re probably the best person to answer the question at a point. How important do you think the character of your parent would be in being able to correctly live in the situation? So let\\'s say that you are in a situation where you would be... You know, maybe a more... Maybe a younger parent or somebody who\\'s a little bit more timid might try and talk it through with an individual or might try and, you know, empathize a little bit more with the abuser or whatever. They could do it in many different ways. Whereas, you know, crafty just made a point, quite on the same point, I could probably make the same point as some people in my family that would just go and turn the whole house upside down, like people were going to jail. Which situation do you think would be better if you were the abuser going to find some kind of comfort or assistance? Well, that\\'s what I was literally going to say with what crafty says to answer the question, is that a professional, if you went to a professional, depending on what you\\'re seeking, they are going to ask you, do you have any family to support you? Because one of the things that the most logical answer, if you\\'re being abused potentially, depending if you\\'ve got kids, you know, all of those things, is there anywhere safe for you to go? So that\\'s the reason why family is an important part, because that could be the safest place for you to go, potentially, but potentially not depending on the abuser. So, yeah, I think family, to answer your question, big bucks, I think what you would probably want from your family is to understand in, and first and foremost is what is the practical things that we need? But also the emotional support, because sometimes the person might be ready to leave. So it might be a bit like someone has addicted, it might just be the emotional support, where the family is right to the fact that they know that their loved ones go right back into that situation. So you need a family that can have a best temperate, that is holding themselves, because they know that they actually, they have to allow their loved one, because they are an adult to go back into that situation, but know that they are there and open if they need me. So that\\'s what I would ask that question, you want a loved one to be able to say, look, I don\\'t want you to go back to me, if you\\'re going to go back to I am here, if you need me, and this is the things that we can do. These are the services, solace that you can go to, domestic help lab. These are the things that you can go to, but a professional will most likely, first and foremost, want to safeguard you, if possible, and say, okay, do you have any money, do you have any family you can go to? Because if you don\\'t have any of that, then the alternative is going to a shelter. And if you\\'ve got children, that\\'s not the best place, they could be stuck in school. You know, these are the things that, that\\'s the reason why I said family is important, but if you don\\'t have that, when you go into the professional lines, it is very, very scary, because you\\'re literally uprooting your whole self, and if it\\'s just you, fine, if it\\'s not just you, it can be very, very scary, taking your kids to a shelter, having to start a game, put them in school and being afraid that this person could find you, if that makes sense. So that\\'s the reason why I disagree and agree with each other, that family pays up an important role, particularly in terms of just protection, and the barrier between you and the abuser, and the professional would there to provide that emotional support, if your family can\\'t provide that, and also statutory support that, you know, is given a help to go to the police, you know, all of those things that maybe a family can\\'t help us move, but in terms of protection, you know, it might be better to go to your family and to go to a shelter. Yeah, no, I heard that, I heard that. So, quick question, maybe to Estol to everyone, what do you think would be a better solution than a shelter, and let\\'s say there is no family, because what you can\\'t have is people staying in that situation, because the shelter is the other option. People do stay, they stay. They do right, yeah, but... That\\'s a really tough question, man. That\\'s a really, really tough question, I mean, but the thing is, it\\'s about providing someone with a refuge. It\\'s about providing them with a place they can go, because they feel safe and understood. And if you can\\'t be a shelter, because the stigma that\\'s attached to you, although if people perceive shelter to be, you then have, what them for instance, based off maybe like having to have conversations with your GP, but then the times you might have to wait to get an appointment, and the logistics of getting to that appointment when you\\'re in this situation, like it\\'s hard. I just can\\'t see... I mean, yes, you\\'ve put us on the spot here with this question, so you obviously, we\\'re thinking about feet, but I just think outside of a shelter, anything that I suggest is going to be some version of a shelter. That\\'s the truth, because you need to provide a stable environment where someone can get away, feel safe, and receive that level of solitude if needed, or support if needed, whether that\\'s through your GP, or going to a shelter shelter, or like... I don\\'t think there is anything else to be on the video, and I don\\'t know if I\\'m being trying to be too Tamil visioned here, but I just don\\'t see what I\\'ll do. That\\'s really in the ground. There\\'s a bit lack of provision, isn\\'t it? So it was like saying, is there anywhere else a homeless person can vote to, rather than a homeless shelter? Well, not much. There\\'s lack of provision, isn\\'t it? Yeah, that\\'s the problem. Let\\'s open up your house to help people come in. There\\'s lack of provision on the ground, and it\\'s the same with the messed up violence shelters, that the fact is there\\'s not many men that, you know, there\\'s a lack of... There\\'s a scarcity and support for men that are going through this. You know, a lot of shelters are for women, because yeah, they have the majority of them that they go through this, but there\\'s still a lot of men that go through this, and they\\'re seeking soloists, and seeking refuge, but I have a feeling of shame, or just feel that there is no where for them to go. You know, so a lot of it is to do with lack of provision. For sure, for sure. So moving on, there\\'s primarily footballers have been told in museum training. So a lot of them have gone back to their clubs, working out, trading, all that kind of stuff, and you know, maybe we\\'ll get some football back. But Troy Dean has said that he\\'s not going back right now. He\\'s just had a child, that child is having respiratory issues, and so making sure that he can basically put the best health kind of foot for him, this is child\\'s possible, he\\'s like, I\\'m not going training, I\\'m not coming in. So Roxanne, I was discussing this with a crafty, and we were like, well, yeah, that makes sense. That\\'s a positive, you know, it\\'s not cool. It\\'s not even a debate. Bear in the mind though, Roxanne and I both, we both have a child, so it\\'s like maybe that way is into it, I don\\'t know. But then party made it to him, it\\'s important that he thinks that it\\'s not actually that straightforward. He doesn\\'t think he\\'s as, okay, so I want to ask you crafty, if it\\'s fine, that Troy Dean is not going to train in, and if not, I would love, love, love to hear the argument as to why that\\'s what we\\'re getting from. I\\'m desperate for this, yeah, because since we had this little, this little child we have a date, we are in time. Time. Alright, basically. Time, basically. Let\\'s go. I\\'m not mad at Dini, and I think everyone should be able to make the choice for them and their family fine. But the problem to me is, at what point does the line get drawn? Because when does it become about your family, or when does it become an advantage that you\\'re just taking? So for example, at work, a lot of people were off sick during the COVID times at the beginning as well, and no one\\'s actually said anything, but there\\'s whispers of, are, is everyone that\\'s off sick? Are they really sick? Or are they just taking this and using this as an advantage? That\\'s not me accusing anyone. It\\'s just a reality of it. There was loads of people off, everyone I spoke to had lots of people off as well. So for me, I have to think to myself, what is so different about this COVID times, and this training session they\\'re trying to have to normal premiership times, and people want to say, \"Oh, the disease, the disease.\" But I put it to you that, Troy Dini every year is used to being away from his child if he\\'s got more than one, but most footballers are used to being away from their family for weeks on end, whether it\\'s pre-season in the country. - But his child has got breathing difficulties though. He\\'s got underlying condition. - Okay, so first of all, there\\'s a lot of footballers out there that probably have all lived with vulnerable people, right? - I don\\'t know, I just know this one, and this one is... - Yeah, you know, I\\'m sure you\\'re right. - You can\\'t be the only person that lives with someone who\\'s vulnerable. - No, no, I\\'m... - A lot of averages suggest you\\'re right. - Yeah, so if the training session should be a case of, guys, let\\'s go away for three weeks or four weeks and have a training session, you\\'ll get tested regularly and it will stop paying at a certain time. You\\'ll get tested every day. When you\\'re clear, you can go home to your family or whatever. So I\\'m just thinking that can be achieved - - It\\'s happened again. It\\'s happened again. - I\\'m supposed to know. - Sorry, it happened again. It happened again. - My bad, I don\\'t know what the white guy\\'s saying here. So I basically think that he could be making a stand on a point that just benefits him today and he wouldn\\'t. It\\'s... I just don\\'t see... I just don\\'t see he\\'s... I just don\\'t think it\\'s right for him to do that personally. - His son is five months old with breathing difficulty. If this is okay now, like... - When is it ever okay? - When is it okay? - Okay, but... - It\\'s... - It\\'s... - It\\'s... - If... - Forget Covid, yeah. So let\\'s take it out, Covid. No, wait, hold on a minute. Hold on. It\\'s saying like this is last year and his five-year-old has breathing... five-month-old has breathing difficulties and it\\'s August or July. If England was playing in the tournament and he got called up or if it\\'s pre-season, they have to go to Dubai. I guarantee you he\\'s probably going to leave his misses and the child at home to go and fulfill his football duties. - Yeah, but... - So to me, I don\\'t think it\\'s anything he can\\'t do. - No, I get that. But I think the difference here is that the child has breathing difficulties, whether he\\'s in here or he\\'s in Dubai, the child got breathing difficulties. If there\\'s a current pandemic and he goes out and he brings something back to his kid, which is then life-threatening, that\\'s a different kind of fish. And that\\'s what we\\'re talking about. You may have put your point... - Why? - Your point is right. Your point is right. If you take... - You may have... - I\\'m going to go to Dubai. If you take COVID out situation, Kravdi, you\\'re absolutely right, because it\\'s on a case-by-case basis, if the player is proactive, or is that the club\\'s discretion to save his okay or not? But the fact that COVID is a situation here is why it\\'s a game changer. - Mm. - That\\'s why it\\'s different. - No, he\\'s a... - No, no, no. - Sorry. - So, Esther, what are you saying? - No, I\\'m just going to say, because I had to... When he sent me the message, I\\'ll crap a football-related question. Let me read up on it. But he\\'s a... He\\'s a blame player. And I think I said that, prior to restarting that, what gives him the reason? Because I\\'m not entering your debate, but actually what I think gives him the confidence is because he\\'s also got money. So he\\'s got money that will also keep him for the next six months to a year, or I don\\'t know how much he gets, whereas somebody else in a different situation might fully have to go into work irrespective, because they haven\\'t got money to take them for a month, or so. So I think that also... He enables his confidence to say, \"Look, I ain\\'t going because he knows that he still got money, but if it was a situation where... He said he doesn\\'t mind losing money, because he\\'s got money. He also got some money left over. - But also, it\\'s his child, guys. - It is so. But there were many people that have children, and other ones were adults that still went to work, because they didn\\'t go to work, and bills didn\\'t even be in paint. - And then they were going to be somewhere else, and they stayed there for a while. - Sorry. - And then I agree with your point, and sometimes they\\'ll go to work, and then have to sleep or stay somewhere else away from their child, because they need to go to work. - COVID is impacted, not only people\\'s health, but the economy has been shot, and people have lost their lives, you know. So, COVID isn\\'t just related to health, it\\'s so many other factors, and you have to think about that. But if I... If I... Right now, because I have to go into work, and I\\'m annoyed about that, because I haven\\'t given the opportunity to work from home, but if I had stacked some money, lay here, do you think I would not easily go to a manager to say, \"You think I\\'m coming to work? \"I beg you, here\\'s my resignation card. \"What can you do because it\\'s money?\" But when you know, \"Hey, bills have to be paid. \"I mean, I\\'m going to work. \"I will go to work every single day.\" You know, but some people went behind to forsake that, but a lot of people were like, \"Well, I\\'ve got bills, and I\\'ve got to go into work.\" - So, just let me come back up. So, that leads to my next point, in terms of the... There\\'s Troy Dini\\'s side of things, and then there\\'s the employer\\'s side of things. Now, as an employer, what does one player doing that, or saying that mean for the rest of the league, or the future? So, let\\'s say there is another wave in December, or maybe there isn\\'t, but let\\'s say COVID is still around to a certain degree. Then, teams, and as a business, it doesn\\'t really work that you have random players, especially starters, for example, saying, \"Do you know what, Alma, my relatives here, or there is ill with this or something?\" And remember, teams or managers or football clubs already give players leeway, is it like if they have a newborn birth, or if someone died, that they\\'re allowed to take leave, given different circumstances, right? - Yeah. - So, what does this mean for the future of football competition, when not even just football, let\\'s say any sport? If this is kind of just accepted and allowed, without any kind of real scrutiny, as they can actually attend, and can he manage this in a better way, rather than just saying, \"No, the risk is out there, so I\\'m staying at home.\" - I know. - How long is he going to do that for one? And secondly, with training, yeah, as he mentioned in phase one, phase two, phase three in training, but when you\\'ve got other leagues in different countries, already giving start dates, or when they\\'re going back, and how they\\'ve dealt with the issue and so on, it\\'s normal and only right, that Premier League clubs would be like, \"You know, this is our kind of preseason now, so we need you guys to come back to training, because it seems like we\\'ve got evidence that other countries are starting back, and they haven\\'t really had any issues, so we would like to be in that position, whether it\\'s September or so. But if you allow this to just go on, how long would it go on for, and how many other players will be like, \"All right, five, I could sit at home as well now.\" - I\\'m gonna come back with you on this here. First, I want to make a few points just to answer your question. For me, and I do think this goes back to the court\\'s first point about maybe you not having a child, and I don\\'t mean to say that this is making me team, but when that\\'s a factor, I\\'m telling you, bro, - That is what a factor, - I\\'ll let you speak. - When that\\'s a factor, I\\'m telling you that family will come first every single time, every single time. Whether or not you\\'re well paid or not becomes unimportant, because if you believe that there\\'s an opportunity for you individually to be bringing so that when you\\'re detrimental to your child, you decide to just not do it. It\\'s a fact. - I agree, I\\'m not bad at it. - I\\'m talking about that. What we can\\'t do is we can\\'t stop people, and even Boris, let\\'s go back to the government principle, right? Even Boris has said, and Matt Henkoff has said that although we are starting to open up markets, and although we are starting to get non-essential businesses open up and working with the social distance, whatever, people should not in any way be criticized if they do not feel that they go back to a safe environment. Now, I know you\\'re saying, okay, well, other leagues have done this, and the PFA and the NIT are testing. They\\'re not doing testing every day. They\\'ve been back training for a week. They\\'ve done two rounds of testing. That doesn\\'t work in terms of the day and every single day. What you\\'re also doing is in them days where you\\'re not being tested, or on those instances where there\\'s a lag in there\\'s a gap, you\\'re relying on the other, well, 100 odd people who are playing in that team, or part of the facilities, or part of the coaching staff, to not be doing reckless shit when they leave that training ground and go home, and come back to the next day. And you\\'ve already seen how many times have you seen Cold Walker having some sex party because he can\\'t stay in his yard, or just once. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - He had just one. - Oh, let\\'s just one. We\\'ve been able to sit for a few years, so that makes us 16 times. - You guys haven\\'t listened to my points properly, because I said he should be away from his family for up to four weeks or so, unless he\\'s worried about his own health, which footballers and sportsmen generally are quite fit, and should be able to be, unless he has underlying conditions, which I doubt, because they have medicals and so on. So he\\'s probably as fit as he can be. - Right, from child\\'s five months. - You can catch it. - He\\'s talking about his months. Now he probably doesn\\'t want to be away from them. You see what I mean? Is there any stages of the child\\'s life? - And this is the other thing. - You wouldn\\'t know. - You can do that. - No, it\\'s not. - So if there was, he wouldn\\'t be playing every week in Premier League. - No, I\\'m saying if the child was five, if the child is five, maybe, if the child is five, maybe he\\'d feel different about it. By five months, it\\'s the beginning. Still have to help out his age. - I think you\\'re saying, you\\'re saying, you\\'re saying, why don\\'t you just isolate yourself, right? You\\'re saying, just be away from your family and go and do your day job. And also, - Normally, he would be, normally you would. - That\\'s fine. That\\'s fine. Let\\'s say that he did that. And then he became, he became, what\\'s the word? He got the virus, and he was asymptomatic. And then you went back home. No symptoms. - No, I wouldn\\'t, because of what I explained earlier, that he would obviously be away for up to a month or so. And the last few days, last week, they\\'re just staying there, being tested before they return back home. And we\\'ve got to remember that these guys need to train and need to be as fit as possible for the start of the season. There\\'s no point saying, oh, we\\'ve lost the first 10 games, when we got back, because we were worried about people\\'s families and we didn\\'t train. If that\\'s what the cause is going to do, then he needs to understand that that\\'s what they\\'re going to do. So I get, look, I don\\'t ever criticize his decision, because as you say, family first, it\\'s not about whether I have a child or not. That to me is quite obvious. What I\\'m trying to say is, I don\\'t believe, I don\\'t believe I would go with his decision, because I know he\\'s capable of doing it. - Fair enough. I mean, that\\'s fair enough. There\\'s no, like, you presented the argument that, I mean, and you\\'ve made it, you\\'ve made it sound incredible in a way, I didn\\'t expect you to. And that\\'s not me being concerned. I just, I couldn\\'t see how anything else could work. But, yeah, I mean, I think I definitely done a rocket science defense in this situation. And I mean, Esther, I think you made your position clear that you understand how perhaps his motivations and why he would make that decision. - Yeah, I think in a different profession, so I think if you do it in a different profession, it might be different. There are many people that do have people that have health issues, but are still going to work because they feel forced to. Not that they want to put their children\\'s or whoever\\'s health and jeopardy, but it will be one thing putting their children\\'s health and jeopardy, and another thing not having no money. And then putting all of your family in jeopardy as well. So I think his, he isn\\'t, his sport career also adds to the reason why he can\\'t even say, \"I\\'m not going to try.\" - I\\'m not going to try. - Yeah. - But remember, there\\'s also key workers that have vulnerable people at home and stuff. - No, no, I get that. - I get that. - I get that. I get that. Which is why, which is why I was very careful not to compare his situation with anyone else, but just to kind of talk about his situation in isolation, in isolation. Guys, go to me one. And it\\'s come to that time of the show where we go into deep, dark corners of my mind. To pull out difficult questions that might make people feel uncomfortable. But I do it anyway. It\\'s time for coming to the conundrum, guys. And today, I\\'m so my friend, Mark. - Mark, what are you going to do? - Before you go into this, before you go into this, I want to know that before we came on camera, you said this was going to be a bang. And you\\'re the best ones. I want everyone to know that he said, \"You are so high, man, \"was gassy.\" - Why would you, why would you please, - No, no, no, no, listen, bro, just so you just carry on in it. I\\'m sorry to interrupt you. - Oh, go on. - Oh, go on. - Carry on, don\\'t do it. So you\\'re sorry to interrupt to me, but I\\'ll call this myself. Okay, cool. - All right, cool. So I\\'ll talk to my friend, and they were concerned about having certain symptoms of corona, feeling tired and blah, blah. But she was particularly pissed about not being able to taste like food, like all her sweets, or like all her favorite foods you couldn\\'t eat. She was just like, this is just trash. This is what I really pissed off about, right? They got me thinking. If you had to lose your sense of taste, or your sense of humor, which one would you give to? - Oh, okay. - Well, for how long, what\\'s the duration? - For life as the every conductor is for life. - Well, for life, for the rest of every life. - Ever taste anything, ever again, or you will never be able to find anything funny, or be funny, ever again. Pick. - That\\'s hard. - Well, did I disappoint? Did I disappoint? - No, even when you were saying it up, I thought you were going to go for taste or smell. - No. - When I bring the heat, bug, you and the conductor. - I think that one before. - If you don\\'t talk about it before, - It\\'s literally okay. - I think one fireman, shit. - All right, all right. - Cool. - Easy, son. Easy. - Chill, chill, chill, get it. - That\\'s where I bounce in. - Oh, like I\\'m saying. That\\'s a good one. That\\'s a good one. That\\'s a good one. - And Rox, seen as you were talking the most, you\\'re going to answer first. - I need time, bro. I need time. - I need time to do it. - I\\'ve decided. - Is it? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. I\\'ve decided. - I mean, I\\'ve decided, but Rox, you\\'re still going first though. So don\\'t look around. - Why are you? - I\\'m on that, bro. I was waiting for you to be like, okay, stop. - I was trying to help you out. I was trying to help you out. - Yeah, go to your nice. - You\\'re too nice. - Go to your nice. Go on, Rox, big man. Big bucks. Can you see my shoulders in this? - I\\'m sure. - I think I\\'m going to answer, and I think it\\'s very hard. It\\'s very, very hard. It\\'s an I love food, obviously, in it. Like, obviously, look at me. But do you know what? If I lost the ability to effectively laugh, genuinely laugh, or to make our people laugh, or to whatever, that\\'s, yeah, yeah. - Sorry, I\\'m not still in the middle of the talk. Listen, take it. Don\\'t do that. Don\\'t do that. Don\\'t do that. You\\'ve got one. You\\'ve been here for like 12 of these. - It\\'s a lie. That\\'s a lie. - That\\'s a lie. - Big hit as well. - Listen, I\\'m going with, I need to maintain my ability to have my sense of humor, because, you know, that feeling of laughing, we take it for granted, isn\\'t it? But, I mean, I\\'m mistake laughing, I\\'m making other people laugh, can provide you with such a symptom joy. And I can change a whole day. Like, if I wake up and I see a meme, just a meme, that is funny as fuck. And I\\'m laughing for having to get my clothes on. That\\'s my whole day up. So my whole day up. - Coming from the Caribbean, yeah? Coming from the Caribbean. The much. - Yeah. - No, no, I know, bro. I know, bro. I know. - I know, yeah. - I\\'ve been to your family barbecues and gatherings. Well, that season is nothing, bro. I mean, it\\'s nothing. - Remember the iron spice, bro? Trust me, I know what food it tastes like. But, yeah. Like, like, like, humor, laughing, like that. - Yeah, there are lots of things. - Yeah, there are lots of things. No, lots of tastes really good, man. Yeah. Ooh. - You missed me. - Look at those tasty jokes. - Okay. - That\\'s tough. That\\'s the one that\\'s good. What were you saying? - You know what? I was like, yeah, I would rather lose humor until he\\'s until Vidwok spoke. I find myself quite funny. I like to laugh a lot. But then I just like to eat. And I just feel like I\\'ll be depressed. Never being able to taste like some nice pounded yam and then some oven and soup and some jollip ice and some nice fried chicken. And I just, oh, yeah. I just so thinking about that, like eating cardboard, but what\\'s the point of eating? Well, actually, with a conundrum, can you add? So if I lost the taste of food and I\\'ve got a pill that I can eat and that just makes me filled up, no, I don\\'t. - No, okay. - No. - Oh, that\\'s a hard one. - I don\\'t know what you\\'re trying to do. - I can\\'t see a loophole, so I\\'ll create one. - There\\'s no loophole. - Okay. Then yeah, you know what? I\\'ll go with my original statement, even though I think Vidwok\\'s like literally, I felt convinced to go with what he said. But I would rather lose my taste of humor and laugh and yamok bare food. - That\\'s the humour, but okay. All right. - Got that. - I wasn\\'t convinced by Big Rock\\'s, not one bit. I\\'m gonna have to go with who\\'s in my sense of humour. And the reason why is because there\\'s a lot of people out there, like, first of all, you guys ain\\'t even that funny, so I don\\'t even laugh. And secondly, there\\'s a lot of people out there that don\\'t find jokes funny or have even been getting it. And whether that\\'s just fit up in, or maybe they even have a condition, but people live their lives without knowing what\\'s funny or what so. There\\'s too many issues with losing taste, and that\\'s going from cooking food. You can\\'t cook for anyone, if you don\\'t know, it tastes like a stuff. And you probably don\\'t even know what your cooking is off. - Mm, me peaches. - All right. - All right. - Mm. - So that\\'s my question, I mean, I question how many people you\\'re cooking for anyway, but like, your point is about it, your point is about it. - Ah! - Um, I personally am giving up my sense of taste. - My game. - Don\\'t give my sense of taste out. There will be. I think that if I lost my sense of taste, yeah, I think I would be in the best shape of my life, because if food, yeah, all taste the same, I can\\'t taste nothing. I might as well eat what\\'s good for me, right? It was good for me being the shape of my life and have jokes every day, well, every day. I don\\'t lose that. I don\\'t lose that. Like, I don\\'t lose the ability to have joy in last thoughts. - Oh, you\\'re just gonna be a funny. - You\\'re just gonna be a funny. - Fucking. - Are you assuming that you\\'re funny or you\\'re going to be funny? - No, but I think, sense of, sense of humor, because you\\'re an ego maniac, you don\\'t understand, that sense of humor works both ways, right? So I don\\'t need to be the funny one. I just need to know funny. - When craft is in the crowded room, everyone\\'s laughing. He\\'s the one in the corner. Just, (indistinct) - Doesn\\'t be like the one laughing. - That\\'s me, there\\'s no more for him. - That\\'s it. It\\'s fine. But for me, yeah, I can find other people funny, bro. So just being around other people in that energy, and stuff I don\\'t want to lose. But if someone\\'s to make sure that broccoli and the hairy bros taste the same, like just a kind of tuna and flipping KFC bucket, taste the same, like I\\'m just gonna eat the healthy stuff, being great shaped and cash-joke all over the world. I\\'ll do that. Compto is easy, easy choice for me to make. Easy choice. That\\'s why I come to the conundrum, man. I got the cheat code. The cheat code, guys, I break it down. I break it down. - I\\'m just gonna make it on behalf of everybody. I say fuck you, because that wasn\\'t funny. (laughing) - Didn\\'t say that was a good one. - Yeah, we could do it. - I do it for the fans, guys. I do it for the fans. - Never. - We wanted them, we wanted them. I know that\\'s what we wanted. (laughing) - Or rather than. - Yes, so, guys, thank you very much, Esther. We appreciate you coming on the show. - Thank you. - Sharing your expertise, your humor, your insights. Thank you very much. - Interesting. - Interesting. - So different. So yeah. - Well, you\\'re welcome back anytime, so, you know. - Well, yeah. - We\\'ll definitely bring you back, bring you back, have you back in person. Big rocks, as always. It\\'s a pleasure. - Pleasure. - Never a chore. - Learn a little bit more about you every single time. (laughing) - There\\'s a lot of work to do. - I\\'m not sure. - I\\'m not sure. - You\\'re welcome. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate your contributions. Hold your corner in some controversial viewpoints, but, you know, as always, you\\'re back to after all. - You\\'ve been working out, are you looking bloke\\'s bro? Is it me? He\\'s looking a little bit more fluid out, bro. What have you been doing? They\\'re press up challenges, yeah? - I feel this t-shirt\\'s a medium, but, but. (laughing) - I ain\\'t got anything in a few weeks, Mark. (laughing) - I love the other Steve Brown. I love the other Steve Brown. - It is. - Yeah. - All right, cool. Yes, and I\\'ve been club nuts. So it\\'s been real. It\\'s been good. It\\'s been real good.

whether thought means quality life people regard mental health better places whether think actually addressing acknowledging way done western world take example live actually better approach want start talk next see thought know initial idea going answer question kind broke thought something else know know ever researched happiest place got best quality life never west like overall never used regions africa usually seen think important mind best quality life research take account everything never west think something put terms question asked think careful compare contrast things like generally speaking question basically saying question saying question kind assumes basically west deals better anywhere else every country deals way need best deal course needs improvements every country different things deal think important make guess called diaspora africa affairs second third generation caribbean obviously important also family back home also ties back home would say better quality life years ago backward way thought mental health know even still engaging conversation public last five years since social media come fore work mental health services say stigma unfortunately

somehow function maybe guess point right point like made really important point like think forced function way necessarily forced function outside mean able craft better quality life got choice nothing jump back much thinking crafting way life based fact forced opinion one things question kind broached almost like know old adage ignorant bliss argue west sort superior inclusive knowledge different breakdowns behind sort psychotherapy mental wellbeing means highlighting possibilities people lot prominently lot someone like obviously experienced teenager coming school advertising mental health lot would home sitting kind blissful ignorance actually going something necessarily platforms within company help understand actually misfereignal actually might end getting accentuating fact

job seekers esa universal credit know bit mattress fall upon allows space time breakdown certain parts africa yes people told along issues people psychophopics trained wanted ask trained abroad good question actually got breakdown trained mean sure kind mix know breakdown would way medicine seen across africa way things kind way people perceive medical educational system would surprised people went abroad get level education special crafty going say something yeah basically mean touching point doctors psychotherapy think said yeah low number country millions people relative mean would say quality life people happy way africa different type community maybe helps way good point community centric rather kind mattress full shall say pillow cushion blow different societies yeah got lot services ramping services mental health time need saying need africa think need much different things stress country talking rat race trying home various things sense community country yeah come together nhs cut hands stuff really see everyday life africa say specifically nigeria guess could argument nhs government welfare system sense community highest level people pay taxes contribute

family structures shame acknowledging mental illness seen weakness agree weakness issue got strong families amazing good families acknowledge weakness sense yes might something need supporting quite difficult quite shamed struggle silence yeah true boils fact triggers mental illness sometimes think surrounding could say stressful life living somewhere quite poor know everyone around position sense community steal things like boils triggers country lots different things contribute mental illness wrap quick question see like eyes like switching like calls head turning worrying thing got

      "{'transcript': ' It may no doubt, with propriety be said, that many who hold slaves live without the fear of God before their eyes. Joseph Smith, 1836 We\\'re listening to Glassbox Podcast. Every two weeks we take on headlines in and out of Mormonism to see what slipped through the cracks. We talk to interesting people and we leave you with the feeling that the world isn\\'t actually on fire in spite of what it actually looks like it is actually on fire in some places. Oh well, my name is Bryce Blanken-Ega. I\\'m your host today is Tuesday, June 23rd, just a few days after Juneteenth. Happy Juneteenth everybody and happy Father\\'s Day. Now let\\'s say Juneteenth. Anyway, joining me of course is my illustrious co-host Braden Am. Braden, you\\'re back from the dead. I am. You are alive and I\\'m so happy to see you on the video. Yes, yes. Last time if you couldn\\'t tell listeners, I was on the verge of death. Yes. Very sick, very ill. And got better and then I got tested for COVID-19 and I tested positive. Yeah, this is like this is no joke. Like you like literally tested positive for COVID. Yes. You caught the run. Yes, not a joke this time. Seriously got it. And luckily I am young-ish in my mid 30s and I am I try to be healthy and you know, I exercise and eat well and don\\'t have any underlying health conditions. So while I got over the worst part of it pretty quickly, there were the lingering effects of tired being very tired and weak. Luckily my children did not get it but my wife got it about 10 days after me, which was interesting. Yeah, that\\'s really interesting. Or started showing symptoms. Started showing symptoms, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So even though we\\'d been together the whole time, somehow she didn\\'t get the symptoms at the same time as I did. She had different symptoms and she actually got over it quicker than I did. Although for her as well, the exhaustion continues to last. She\\'s still experiencing that symptom. And so yeah, wild, very wild. Yeah. So Braden is recording as a zombie this week. It\\'s super cool. I mean, he doesn\\'t have like the rotting flesh or those symptoms that you normally see like blood dripping from his mouth. You know, it\\'s, you know what, Hollywood just mixes everything up and gives us all false impressions zombies are actually dapper looking fellows on the opposite sides of Skype calls. Not actually the fleshening monsters that we see in Hollywood. Yeah, crazy stuff, man. You caught it. Annie and I, we suspected that she might have brought it back home with her from visiting her mom. So we both got tested. Luckily we were negative. The test was uncomfortable but doable. And if I remember what you said, it was like when we last recorded was like the day before your worst symptoms when you slept for like 15 hours of the day and you were aching, you were favored, you were in really bad shape the day after we recorded, right? Yeah. Yeah. I was really struggling that night while we were recording and you know, we recorded late into the night. I was very, very tired and then I think that next day was my worst day and that night when I was sleeping, I think that\\'s when my fever reached its peak and broke. And then I started, that\\'s when I kind of started slowly feel better throughout that next day or two. But yeah, so yeah, it was pretty crazy. I didn\\'t know I had COVID at the time and didn\\'t even, I mean, I wondered obviously, but I didn\\'t think I actually had it until a friend tested positive. So I went and got tested myself. It\\'s amazing stuff. Yeah. And you know, a lot of people are banning about talking about, you know, at this point because America is has done, I mean, nothing to flatten the curve. Like, I mean, the state home orders and stuff are now being lifted while cases are increasing exponentially. Once again, they slowed down for a little while, but now I think it was just today that New Jersey hospitals are operating at capacity again and other, you know, well populated states are beginning to get close to the hospital capacities, thousands of new cases every single day. And it\\'s pretty well accepted by a lot of people now that everybody\\'s in America is going to get it, right? And that sucks. What that does mean though is that with the current mortality rates, we\\'re looking at probably 15 million people that die from it. That\\'s a rough estimate of 330 million people get it. I mean, that\\'s pretty back of the napkin calculations. So everybody look around you and consider how many people you interact with or you see every day. Yeah, not all those people are going to be around because people are fucking idiots and are refusing to wear their face masks just out of courtesy, refusing to obey social distancing and lockdown orders and they are through negligence murdering other people, just because people are not taking it seriously, especially in places where it\\'s regarded as, I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this, but our president just used it. The kung flu. Oh, is he still saying that? Oh my God. He said that in his rally today. So that\\'s super duper fun. What a great man. Great man. Great man. He also admitted at the same rally that he ordered the testing to slow down because if you don\\'t test for something, you know that you don\\'t know how big the problem is. So great. That\\'s how things work. That\\'s how things work. So yeah, today\\'s episode, we\\'re doing kind of an amalgamation of a bunch of topics in the headlines. Of course, we\\'re taking a Mormon angle of current events. That\\'s going to be kind of near the end of the episode, but we\\'re going to get into how the protests have developed concerning, you know, the catalyst that was the beginning of these latest riots was George Floyd and all of the other issues and all of the other victims of police brutality that have been looped up into this large, I mean, it\\'s not Nate. It\\'s worldwide. It\\'s a worldwide movement to end police brutality and systemic racism. We\\'re going to talk about what has happened, the developments that have been happening. And of course, we\\'re going to, you know, briefly touch on on COVID and what it\\'s currently looking like right now and kind of wrap all these things together. But then of course, we have a media of great price and we also have some good news that\\'s coming out of these because it was a surprisingly good last few weeks in the Supreme Court. So those are going to be our happy news segment kind of wrapped up into the main segment here. And yeah, well, what do you say we jump right in, Braden? Let\\'s talk about all right. So Braden, before we get into the main segment and talking about current events, I want to discuss something that came up last episode because you and I recorded the introduction or the beginning of last week\\'s episode. And I don\\'t know about you, but after we were done recording that bit, you know, basically voice acting out the George Floyd murder that I was in some pieces. I had to take a few minutes to gather myself back together before we could go on and record the rest of the episode. And it seemed like you were in the same kind of headspace. Let\\'s talk a little bit about how we started last week\\'s episode because we received some feedback from people who said that they wanted a trigger warning on it. And I think there are some relevant criticisms there. And I think we should just discuss that because stuff that we\\'re going to talk about today, if last week\\'s episode was the introduction was triggering, then maybe some of the content of today is going to be triggering as well. So I want to kind of get out, lay out our cards on the table and kind of come down with what we think about doing trigger warnings on episodes like that. Yeah, I think that\\'s valid. And if someone says they\\'re something that we say is upsetting to them, then we need to listen. I think that\\'s kind of the common consensus right now that\\'s going around with a lot of different issues is not to tell someone what they experience is wrong. So someone says something we say deserves a trigger warning, then we cover a lot of sensitive topics, especially last episode. We\\'ve voice acted. George Floyd\\'s got video, eight minutes and 46 seconds. And yeah, that was hard to do. But for me, it was a little therapeutic, but everybody reacts to things differently. Yeah, yeah. And there\\'s, so I want to just talk broadly about trigger warnings at a high level view. There was a recent study that was published in American psychology that weighed the pros and cons of trigger warnings. And it basically said that they in some respects, they can have more negative impact than they can have positive impact. But one thing is a problem with studying trigger warnings, obviously, is there\\'s it\\'s been a cultural practice in small circles for such a short amount of time. It\\'s very hard to tease out the signal from the noise on whether or not they\\'re actually beneficial. There are pros and cons. I\\'m not going to walk through them here. So, you know, psychologists are going to continue to study trigger warnings. And what I\\'m going to say is we\\'re going to exercise caution with material that is sensitive or, you know, adult themed material that way moving forward as well. I\\'ll also say that I recorded a very short bumper at the beginning of last week\\'s episode and edited it in. Although I know that that\\'s often going to be or that\\'s probably going to be seen as too little too late because most of our listeners have already heard the episode. But just a future listeners, new listeners, whatever, if they want to tap into that and hear it, then they will have a very brief warning at the beginning. But I also want to say the last episode specifically, the reason why we decided to do it was because we knew the entire episode was going to be very depressing. And it was going to hurt a lot to listen to. And we wanted to give our listeners basically the hardest thing to listen to at the beginning, because we knew by the end of the episode, we were going to be lifting everybody up and say, this feels so depressing and like all hope is lost, but there are ways to help. There are ways moving forward. There are ways to make meaningful changes. And that\\'s why we spent so much time last episode providing resources to everybody. And why I said listeners, if you don\\'t click on one of the links in the show notes, then we\\'re not friends anymore. Because it\\'s very important that listeners understand that if we\\'re going to talk about a hard topic, we\\'re going to give you some respite at the end, we\\'re going to lift you back up. And that\\'s why we do a happy new segment at the end of every episode. Because even if it\\'s tough subject material, if it\\'s a tough topic, we do want you to, at the end of it, after you\\'ve gone on this rough journey with us, we want you to still feel like not all hope is lost and that there is some semblance of normalcy and the world is overall good, even if we do oftentimes as a culture focus on what seems to be the bad. And it\\'s a breath of fresh air at the end of discussing something very heavy in general. Yeah. And so with that, so Alice was specifically our personal friend of mine, Alice, a longtime listener of the show, she said specifically that it was triggering as fuck and I\\'m a white girl. Which means that a lot of the people of color, a lot of the black people that I have begun following since all of this has begun have been very emphatic about saying, don\\'t show more videos, don\\'t tweet at me videos of police shooting people. It doesn\\'t do me any good. I\\'ve seen this. I know that this is a fear that I live with even if it\\'s new to you. And to that, I say, I know that our listening audience is almost exclusively white, right? So white and ex-morman. So I say that because I think what\\'s more important is getting people who are listening or are very, very large demographic of the listening audience, getting them in the right mind space by triggering those feelings, by causing those feelings to come over them. So what I\\'m going to say is listeners, if there are events that are going on and you\\'re going to click on this episode, you\\'re going to click on an episode, listen, we put a lot of time and effort into researching and putting together the episodes in a way that\\'s concise and as simple as it possibly can and get through enough topics and the right topics in the right order to make it accessible. And we also, I personally put a number of hours into putting together the little paragraph that you see on the episode description. So what I\\'m going to say is I\\'m going to ask you listeners for all of the effort that Braden and I put into the show, I\\'m going to ask that you reciprocate that effort by taking the 20 seconds to read the show description, that little paragraph, before you listen to it, if the title or if you, there are current events that you think that we\\'re going to be covering that may possibly be triggering for you. And I don\\'t think that\\'s an unreasonable ask, right? Like we put hours and hours into the show asking for 20 seconds of your time to just read a paragraph. I feel like that\\'s reasonable. Absolutely. So how do I address that? Why don\\'t we talk about headlines? Oh man, you see the notes. Yeah. You want to start with the email from the end of ACP? Yeah, let\\'s get into that because this is, you know, I don\\'t know if you\\'re on the mailing list for the end of ACP. We\\'ve recently, you know, Annie and I have recently started monthly donations and we\\'re receiving all of their newsletters. There\\'s a lot going on there. They\\'re communicating to their donors a lot of information. It\\'s super helpful. All across our nation, people are beginning to speak out about the horrors and brutality of law enforcement misconduct and the fact that people of color disproportionately African Americans are treated more harshly by law enforcement officers, often fatally. People are looking to our local state and federal leaders for real change. At the federal level, the NAACP is in strong support of the provisions in HR 7120, the \"George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.\" Among other things, the legislation holds all law enforcement officials accountable for their actions, \"an qualified immunity,\" and \"for police officers,\" ends racial and religious profiling, and powers our communities, establishes uniform policies for the use of force, mandates data collection on police encounters, bans, chokeholds, and no-knock warrants, limits military equipment on American streets, requires body worn cameras, and classifies lynching as a hate crime. That wasn\\'t already a hate crime. So I know I\\'m right. Right? Isn\\'t that bonkers? Therefore, making it open to federal resources for investigations and prosecutions. Police reform legislation is scheduled to be considered in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate next week. Wow. Yeah, I found this email incredibly encouraging because this is a sweeping police reform act. Well, I mean, I guess sweeping is a subjective term, but there\\'s a major overhauls of policing conduct that are going through with this, and now it is in front of the House of Representatives. This would not have happened. There was societal unrest, right? Yeah. This right here is a, this is demonstrable proof that the every major city in America for the past almost a month now have had daily or weekly protests of thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people clogging up the city and filling it with bodies, with people who are yelling, people who are chanting. This is because protesting works, protesting, demonstrating and getting media talking about these issues works. And without all of this happening, without the societal unrest, these bills would never, ever have been brought for serious discussion. And the people who are sponsoring these bills and bringing these bills forward would never, ever have the leverage that they need for them to even be considered in the first place. Super good news, dude. That is super amazing good news. Yes. The voices out there right now are what is lifting these things up and bringing them out and making them happen and if that didn\\'t happen, then lynches would not be a hate crime still. Yeah. Crazy that at a federal level lynching is not a hate crime. And I also should note that like there have been about half a dozen ruled as suicides of black young men hanging from trees in, you know, there was the one that was very low amount publicized in Palmdale, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. But there have been a string of other suicides by hanging from trees of black men in communities where protests have been happening. So yeah, let\\'s keep in mind that lynching is such a horrific, racially charged, violent act and that those things are going on. And then classifying lynching as a hate crime is probably a really, really good idea. And having those public lynchings that are happening right now are also giving leverage to bring that bill forward and keep that provision within it and not have it stricken or filibuster or amended. Yeah. So that\\'s awesome. Yes. It\\'s horrifying. It is horrifying. Those things are happening in the 21st century. Racial lynchings, black men getting hung from trees in neighborhoods during protests. That\\'s that is unconscionably evil. That is so outrageously and egregiously evil. And I mean, yeah, it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s horrifying. And that\\'s what that\\'s what makes me so upset when you hear that, you know, when people talk like all of this is only because of George Floyd. Yeah. No, he was no, no, he was the catalyst. That\\'s it. Yes. It was a horrific thing that we all saw because it was filmed and that was just the catalyst that was the straw that broke the camel\\'s back. That was the final straw that in it and it launched all of this because it was just like really fucking really still again, again, another one. Another one. Yeah. So it was what we got through a mod arbery like when when that video was released, right? And that was like that was a former cop. Like that wasn\\'t even an on duty officer. That was just a dude and his son who were raving bigots and just shot a dude who was running through their neighborhood, right? Yeah, trying to take it enforcement into their own hands, take the law into their own hands. Right. Right. So yeah, I mean, like progress and growth is is ugly and a lot of bad things happen. Hiring progress and growth. But all of these people, I don\\'t know how to say this without without sounding like I\\'m trivializing or I\\'m maybe falsely elevating these people or whatever the case may be. But every one of these people, every one of these people who are tragically killed by whether it\\'s by citizens committing hate crimes or whether it\\'s police officers who are excessively brutal, who are who are doing that brutality while following police protocol. Really? I mean, that\\'s that\\'s really a central issue here. Those people are dying for the cause unwillingly. Those people are martyrs for civil rights. Just like every other martyr for civil rights has been. And those martyrs for civil rights have been, you know, largely black people who have been fighting the racially charged system that we live in, right? Those are the people who are anti-racist who are trying to get change to go through fighting against an incredibly overwhelming force that doesn\\'t want them to have equal rights. And the word martyr is such a loaded term because it\\'s always associated with religion. And that\\'s not what I\\'m trying to do. I\\'m not trying to trivialize it or I\\'m not trying to sanctify these people or something like that. I\\'m just saying that these people are unwilling martyrs because societal change is following their deaths. And we have to deal with that information. We have to deal with what these people are, whether we they\\'re regarded as statistics or whether they are regarded as milestones along societal progression. And even when I say that, when I listen back to this in the editing room, I\\'m going to be like, why did you say that, Bryce? You idiot. And I\\'m trying to be so careful with how I choose my words and convey this without sounding like I\\'m mischaracterizing it. But like these are societal changes that need to happen and they\\'re happening unfortunately because all of these people are dying for no reason. Yeah. I\\'ve taken the approach that I\\'m probably going to say things the wrong way or have missteps or misrepresent things. Yeah, ma\\'am. Me too. But I\\'m trying not to and I hope I don\\'t. But I hear what you\\'re saying. It\\'s a difficult time. There\\'s a lot of difficult things to talk about. And there\\'s a lot of words that people pick out. I\\'ve heard that argument like people are. The left, the liberals, they\\'re making George Floyd out to be a martyr. And then you look at the definition of martyr, it\\'s like, well, is he a martyr? And I like what you said he\\'s an unwilling or these victims are unwilling martyrs. And it\\'s not about their past. It\\'s not about the bad things they did in their lives before. It\\'s about a human being that died. Right. It\\'s about a human being that died unjustly and the societal change which follows that unjust death. Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And I will also, you know, I\\'ll echo that point and say that even if our word choice isn\\'t accurate, even if, because you and I, like I\\'m not, I don\\'t know these issues very well. I\\'m only beginning to learn them now, right? Like it takes societal unrest for white people to wake up and say, oh shit, something\\'s wrong. Oh, I mean, I\\'m comfortable. Why? Why are y\\'all writing? So like it takes these events to shake us out of our comfort zone to actually, to acknowledge that there are things that need to be known that I need to know are, are, it\\'s the intent that really matters. Right. And like I think that you and I are approaching this with a good intent to try and learn the issues as much as possible and to be able to communicate those issues to a largely white audience. And I think that, you know, the beginning of this episode illustrates that you and I are very open to corrections. And we encourage corrections if we\\'re using incorrect terminology and so on. So I just want people to understand that like it\\'s our, we are, we have only the best intentions here. If we choose the wrong word, please help us out. Please educate us because we are, we\\'re learning this together. Yeah. So I want to talk about our president. And that\\'s going to suck for a lot of us because a lot of us really hate our current president. So well, but maybe it\\'s not going to suck because I\\'m going to spend the next quite a while ripping him to shreds because he is a villain. Like he is absolutely a villain, right? Take it. Trump held a large press conference where he signed an executive order on police reform. And we\\'re going to get into the material of that police reform here in just a minute here. But I think what is super duper important before we read the material of his police reform order is getting at the root of the people who were around him, who took pens away from the signing when he pulled them all out of the box and handed each of these people pens, who were all those people surrounding him and who were the supporters, the sponsors of his executive order. Because I think that says a lot more about the intentions and what will be the end results of the executive order than what\\'s in the actual words themselves. So let\\'s talk about who Trump mentioned during that press conference. And then we\\'ll talk about the text of the order itself because there\\'s a lot to tease out here. First, he said federal law enforcement officers association and he went through a number of associations, organizations, and unions who are the supporters of these and he was thanking them for all of their support. So federal law enforcement officers association, they support ICE. Quote, we applaud the president\\'s initiative to build a barrier along the southern border and to properly reinforce the needs of ICE, US BP and CBP officers. End quote. That\\'s one of their tweets. They viciously oppose the sanctuary city bill, which would curtail the power of immigration officials. And they are just rabid. If you read federal law enforcement officers association, if you read their tweets, they are rabid Trump supporters in spite of claiming to be nonpartisan and nonpolitical nonprofit organization. Then we have the fraternal order of the police. And if you check the show notes, you\\'re going to find links to all of these wonderful organizations, home pages, landing pages, and you can even check on their leadership and see the pictures of all of the beautiful white men who are the leaders of all these organizations. So fraternal order police, they represent over 330,000 officers in 2,200 different colleges across America. They\\'re pretty standard, apart from the course police union. They\\'re currently fighting to ensure social security payments for officers. This is what\\'s in their newsroom right now. But also fighting for a bill that allows those officers to opt out of social security, paying into social security if they\\'re instead contributing to their own retirement. So that\\'s not how social security works, but that\\'s one of the two of the bills that they\\'re fighting for. They\\'re also supporting bills to increase the bargaining power of police officers unions. We have the internal association of chiefs of police. And this was one of the most reasonable of all of the unions that I saw that Trump listed out during the press conference. I\\'m going to read a quote from their website here. This, like I said, this is the most reasonable out of all of them. Unfortunately, some protests devolved into acts of violence and destruction, which has only served a distract from these concerns and further harm communities that are already suffering. Officers throughout the country deserve recognition for their efforts to contain the purposeful and directed agitation, capitalizing on the opportunity presented by well-intended protests. The officers on wavering courage and dedication to public service is a credit to them and emblematic of the true values of policing of the policing profession. So, yeah, some officers are ill-intentioned, but the rest of the officers, we support them for dealing with those who are purposeful and directly agitating the officers. It continues, \"Nevertheless, it is imperative that we not let violence and destruction distract us from the real challenge before us, determining how we move beyond the pain of frustration to identify, develop, and implement systemic solutions to build safer, more just communities.\" Like I said, that was the most reasonable out of all of these, at least their head is on straight about approaching the systemic, large community issues to build safer, more just communities. All of those words are incredibly subjective when they\\'re coming from a police union, of course, right? We have the International Union of Police Association. Their catch line is the voice of law enforcement officers. And they are basically a defense fund for police officers who provide legal services to those officers and training for any officers who are caught up in legal disputes, like murdering people who are in their custody. Then we have major county sheriffs of America Association. They have, I looked through their leadership board, they have one non-white, non-male person on their board, sheriff Margaret Mims, all white people. There, so major county sheriffs of America Association, their corporate sponsors page is basically the who\\'s who of major corporations with everything from tech and cell phone companies so they can tap into people\\'s cell phones and use location data to facial recognition software research companies to armor and weapons companies to correct RX and diamond farta pseudocool companies who are supporting this major county sheriffs of America Association and major for-profit prison companies who are their corporate sponsors for this police union. And listeners, you\\'ll finally say everything in the show notes. You don\\'t, I mean, you can trust me on what I\\'m saying, or you can go ahead and reproduce the research yourself. I mean, read it up. Figure out who the people are who trumps in bed with here. All right. We also have National Association of Police Organizations, the president of this organization, Michael McHail recently appeared on Fox News about the George Floyd protests and he has a picture of himself with Attorney General Bill Barr. And he blamed the protesters on that Fox News interview for the violence instead of the police where the blame rightfully belongs. Because he\\'s a police union guy, right? So this guy, National Association of Police Orgs, President Michael McHail recently sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, which opposed the end of qualified immunity, which is part of the George Floyd bill that is going up in front of the House and Senate this week. And it has a bunch of other complaints that police reforms are unacceptable, that they can\\'t do these reformations that are currently at issue with the George Floyd act that is being discussed. Then we have the National District Attorneys Association. And this is the Defense Association for Police Officers who are involved in litigation. This is another legal defense fund. They provide lawyers to officers who are charged with excessive brutality or killing somebody. Then we have the Sargent\\'s Benevolence Association. This is a standard police union founded in New York City in 1899. The Associated Press classifies the Sargent\\'s Benevolent Association as a partisan association based on its controversial Twitter account. And I looked it up. Every single tweet from Sargent\\'s Benevolence Association is a tweet supporting Trump. They also, they are conservative hacks. They have a tweet supporting a former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, a current tweet supporting Attorney General Bill Barr. Police officers who are on the front lines with these riots and all of them are blaming the protesters for the violence and the escalation. They also consider police body cams to be \"anti-police bills.\" Really great. They have also, since they\\'re founding in 1899, they have never had a non-white non-male president. These are all of the organizations, and Trump also said, and many, many more. These are all the organizations that were in support of Trump\\'s executive order on police reform. I think that right there speaks volumes without even opening the bill itself without opening the executive order. I think we can kind of see the direction that this order is going. Right. That\\'s a big list of people who should have been involved in that executive order. Yeah, that leads to a question who wasn\\'t at the signing, right? There was one black person at the signing. All the people were dressed up in military regalia. There was one black guy there. The rest were white men. But who did Trump not mention at this executive order signing? The NAACP. Let\\'s alternate, why don\\'t we? Because I compiled quite a list here. Yeah. Or I could just read the whole list because- Yeah, sure. The NAACP, Black Lives Matter, the Black Futures Lab, Center for Policing Equity, National Black Justice Coalition, the SPLC, the American Psychological Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Campaign Zero, the Marshall Project, ACLU, all of us or none, Alliance of Families for Justice, the Anti-Violence Project, Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity, Bill of Rights Defense Committee, Coalition for Police Accountability, Communities United Against Police Brutality. Yeah, that one\\'s in Minnesota, actually. Yeah, at least in Minnesota. You\\'d think that of all of these organizations, that would be a really, really good one to have at this executive order signing. What do you even mention? Yeah. It should have had a seat at that table, for sure. Yeah. The Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility and LACE, Families Against Stop and Frisk, Hands Up United, Justice Committee, Law Enforcement Action Partnership, Mapping the Field, Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, Mothers Against Police Brutality, Neighbors Organizing for Change, Picture the Homeless, Racial Justice Now, Transgender Law Center, and Hundreds of other possible orgs. So the executive order about police brutality and police accountability and the only people there were people who are police or represent the police and benefit from the police financially. No one who has suffered at the hands of the police, who has experienced injustice from the police, who is fighting against police injustice and police brutality, none of them were invited. None of them were invited. None of them were said at the table. None of them were sponsors. No, none of them contributed. This is very lopsided. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I think that reveals intentions a lot more than anything. Like priorities and intentions. And like the list that I put together, that could have gone on for the rest of the show. There are hundreds of organizations who are working for police reform, nonprofit, nonpolitical, you know, nonpartisan organizations who are trying to bring about change. And who does Trump bring into the discussion? A massive list of police unions who really are in so many ways at the center of these discussions, right? Braden, did you watch the John Oliver segment on police unions? No, I haven\\'t. I haven\\'t. I watched a small snippet that I think was about a minute long on Facebook. I meant to watch the whole episode, but I know I did not. But I know. He made a salient point is that police unions have bargaining power than no other unions in America have. They can say, if you don\\'t do what we want, if you don\\'t give us the money we want, if you don\\'t give us the overtime pay or the benefits that we want, then, well, we\\'re just not going to police your city and then crime is going to go through the roof. No other like that\\'s mafia family shit, right? But no other, no other union has that power, right? And we\\'re going to get into that a little bit when we get to talking about the Capitol Hill zone as well as what\\'s going on in Atlanta right now. But like that\\'s really an important point here is that these police unions have far more leverage than any other labor union has. And that means that they obviously occupy a larger seat at the table than any of the organizations who are working to reform police. It\\'s a very lopsided battle and it\\'s a battle that has been going on since the formation of police departments. Right. You know, and yeah, and run away slave groups and stuff. So it\\'s just, it\\'s an important point to really tease out. So I want to talk about the executive order. What did the executive order that Trump signed actually do? You can find a link to the show notes. Of course, it created a quote independent credentialing bodies, an end quote to assess police practices, which, hey, that sounds, that sounds pretty good independent credentialing bodies. So basically, police departments have to reapply for accreditation every year, I assume, and have to pass a certain test to say that we\\'re, we\\'re, we\\'re, you know, reforming or we\\'re doing better or we\\'re cutting back on the funding or we\\'re doing whatever that\\'s improving our policing practices. And this is an independent credentialing body. I don\\'t know what that is. I don\\'t know exactly what that is. It\\'s, you know, if that\\'s going to be a for profit organization, who does the credentialing or if that\\'s going to be, you know, a government private partnership or if that\\'s going to be a strictly government non-partisan, overseeing body, I don\\'t know what that means, right? The language is too vague because it\\'s an executive order. It\\'s not real legislation, right? It has the potential to be good if the right people are the credentialing bodies at the right, right. And that\\'s one point I also want to make here is that there are a number of points in the executive order that are super good if used by the right hands, just like any other tool, any tool can be wielded for good or evil. And like the next point in it, it creates a central reporting agency of police brutality. And you and I talked about that last week. There, that doesn\\'t exist, right? Right. Like government agencies, private agencies have infinite data on you and me and everybody else, right? But there is no independent body. There is no data collection that tracks police brutality and police shootings. It\\'s all left up to independent journalists to collect that data. So that means that the numbers are just, you can\\'t, you can\\'t rectify a problem if you don\\'t understand the scope of it, right? But that can only be the product of deliberate action or deliberate inaction, I guess I should say. Yeah. And that solves the problem that we talked about on the last episode of their stats that not having those, we don\\'t have a full picture of those statistics. So we, you know, knowing about all of the shootings or people who deny that police shootings or police brutality is disproportionately affecting the African American community. They\\'ll be able to say the statistics don\\'t show that or these statistics do, but those don\\'t, it\\'s because we have an incomplete data source. And so this, the creating the central reporting of police brutality, that part of the executive order will over time make that less of an issue. Hopefully. Right. So this is a tool that is being created by executive order, not by legislation, which is the wrong way to go about this, right? But it\\'s being created and it can be wielded, right? So it also, so in reference to the independent credentialing bodies, which are, I assume are going to be the agencies that are collecting all of the data, it\\'s up to the Department of Justice to provide grant funding to supply these independent credentialing bodies. So basically you have to apply directly to the attorney general in order to be, uh, to be one of the agencies who does the police credentialing, which means that the attorney general who is currently a Trump hack, a howler monkey, a lap dog is the person who says, yeah, I grant you funding or no, I\\'m not granting you funding to study police brutality. So once again, um, it\\'s also supposed to collect data on abusive practices such as chokeholds, but the executive order did not ban them. It\\'s just supposed to collect data on them, uh, which is very, very troubling. Um, and all of this, uh, more importantly, every single section in the executive order runs everything through the Department of Justice, which means it\\'s all through attorney general Bill Barr and Bill Barr is the guy who lied about the molar report and redacted hundreds of crucial paragraphs from it. He\\'s a lap dog. He has single handedly solid the reputation of the entire Department of Justice. He\\'s the guy who ordered the clearing, uh, maybe maybe it was Ivanka. I don\\'t know. Nobody really knows, but the clearing of Lafayette Square. So true. Could go hold his Bible upside down and get a photo op. Right. Uh, like he, he is, uh, an absolute monster. He, he has done more to damage the reputation of the indip, though supposedly independent body of the department of justice than any single other person has. Uh, and currently like right now there\\'s a dispute about an inspector general who is being fired, but isn\\'t fired, but like the president can fire him, but like, uh, attorney general bar was the person who\\'s firing him and Trump said, I don\\'t know anything about it. Like there\\'s a huge dispute about that going on right now about like who has the power to say that this person who was looking into our dirty laundry, we\\'re going to fire this fucker. Um, it seems crazy to me that those questions, those conversations are happening of like, okay, so we\\'re going to fire the person who\\'s investigating corruption in government. We just have to determine who has the legal authority to fire this guy before he finds anything out. Fucking bonkers to me. Anyway, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s, it\\'s an aristocracy. All right. So all of this is under a bill bar and then records of police brutality, quote, shall regularly and periodically make available or the attorney general shall regularly and periodically make available to the public, aggregated and anonymized data from the database. End quote. So, um, all of these, these credentialing bodies who are collecting the information on police brutality and, uh, police, uh, murdering, uh, citizens and all this information, it\\'s all being funneled into bill bar bill bar or the attorney general, but it\\'s bill bar right now. Right. He is the guy who when requested or regularly and periodically, he\\'s supposed to release the data on that police brutality. Um, it doesn\\'t establish, uh, intervals. So the regular and periodical intervals could be every two months. They could be a once a week. They could be every 10 years. It doesn\\'t state how regularly he shall make these reports. And they\\'re also an anemized, which makes it a lot harder, uh, you know, to, to determine if the, I\\'m sure that the person\\'s race is going to be collected in the data. Um, but it might not be if the data is an anemized, it makes it harder to determine the size and scope of the problem as well as the racial, uh, the, the race of the person who was the victim of the police crime and brutality. Um, made this all at the discretion and the control of the department of justice, who is the attorney general bill bar who is head of the department of justice. It is not run through, uh, the department of health and human services, which you think it might be. Uh, it\\'s not run through the CDC who is supposed to collect, um, deaths, uh, untimely death data. Um, it\\'s not run through housing and urban development who has all the data on redlining districts and, uh, on racial, uh, demographics of areas in certain cities and has a lot more data on the policing of those areas. It\\'s not the department of labor. Um, it\\'s more importantly where it really should be. It\\'s not controlled by the department of homeland security. It\\'s all just the department of justice. It\\'s all funneled through the one Trump hack. So in conclusion, Trump\\'s executive order, given the police unions who were the signatories and who supported this and who had a seat at the table and given everything that is in the actual text of it, the conclusion of this executive order is pure unadulterated blue lives matter. It\\'s not black lives matter. It\\'s not all lives matter. It is blue lives matter. That was the entire executive order. Wow. That\\'s too bad. It\\'s not too bad. It\\'s wrong. It is evil. It is brazenly racist. It is antagonizing a society that is thrown into the chaos and upheaval of race riots. It is it is. It\\'s, it\\'s, I mean, and tone deaf. I mean, there\\'s ableist language in that. And that is just too generous to call this tone deaf. It is any descriptor that we try and ascribe to this is too generous to what is happening. This is, this is atrocious. This is absolutely atrocious. This should be absolutely criminal, criminally negligent. This should be absolutely wrong. This right here, given the current events, this should be an impeachable offense. This is an abuse of power. This is stoking racial tensions when millions of people across the nation are currently protesting racial disparate outcomes in society. This is fucking wrong is what this is. Yeah. It\\'s a shame. It\\'s a shame. Which leads back to the point that John Oliver made. Police unions have an insane amount of bargaining power, right? And that\\'s why all of them had a seat at the table, not black lives matter, right? And what just happened in Atlanta is fucking insane. The police just said, we\\'re not going to answer 911 calls unless it\\'s officer down. They just said, we\\'re not coming to your community. We\\'re not doing anything. You want to keep us from shooting unarmed black men and from, you know, shooting you groups of people with tear gas. You want to keep us from using choke holds on you? Fine, then we\\'re not going to do our job. Petulant fucking children that\\'s going to result in the deaths of innocent citizens. I didn\\'t know about this, so I\\'m reading it right now. Wow. Yeah. This is hard because, you know, I have friends, I have family who are in law enforcement, but I also have friends and family who are people of color who I care about. And guess which of those I\\'m less worried about right now. And this story is this article, this what\\'s happening in Atlanta. That\\'s troubling to me. Because it was in response to Ray Char Brooks. Right. And in light of what\\'s the, you know, us talking about the executive order, it\\'s the bullies are whining about how it\\'s going to change life for them and the government is listening. But the government\\'s not listening to the victims of those bullies who are losing their lives because of them. Right. And that is very troublesome. And the fact that they\\'re just saying, fine, we\\'re not going to help when the help is needed is just ridiculous that they can do that. And that they have the power to do that without repercussion. Maybe there will be repercussion. I don\\'t know, but it doesn\\'t seem to be that way. It seems like they feel pretty confident and emboldened to do that. Otherwise, they wouldn\\'t. You know, there\\'s a reason they feel like they can do something so drastic. And it\\'s because the system supports them. And that\\'s scary. And like where are all of the right to work people who are all about busting unions, right? Like when this happened with, you know, pilots during Reagan\\'s presidency, he just said, okay, don\\'t come back to work. We\\'ll hire all new pilots. Take a fucking hike. There\\'s an opportunity with Atlanta. And we\\'re going to discuss this a little bit when we get into the defund stuff because we\\'re going to talk about defunding here in a little bit. But there\\'s an opportunity Atlanta has here right now. And that would be, okay, so we don\\'t have police officers. Why don\\'t we take all of the X number of, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars that are funded to them? Why don\\'t we immediately fund emergency task for social workers who are unarmed who are going to answer all of the 911 calls? And you know, the police walk out, show the police that, okay, you\\'re going to walk away from your job. We\\'re going to find people who do your job but better. The problem is, is that takes a lot of time? That takes a lot of time to build that infrastructure. And people are going to become victims of crime during that time, especially because a lot of people right now, Braden, I don\\'t know if you knew this, but we\\'re currently in the middle of a global pandemic. A lot of people are out of work. A lot of people don\\'t have any way for any source of income. And a lot of people are resorting to crime in order to keep food on the table and find their family. So a lot of people are going to become victims of crimes while, you know, if Atlanta chooses to capitalize on this, this opportunity instead of viewing this as these police officers can\\'t just walk away, what will happen to our communities? And this is one of those things where it\\'s like societal growth needs to happen. And if a union has too much bargaining power, just like Reagan did in the 1980s, you have to take drastic measures to break those unions. I for one, vociferously disagree with breaking unions. But when a union has as much bargaining power as saying, we\\'re going to walk away from our jobs and then all of you are going to die, it\\'s going to be the purge, whether or not that\\'s true. If they\\'re using that as their bargaining power, that union has too much power because police officers do too much in society. That\\'s I think become abundantly clear to everybody. Police officers do too much. They are called in to every single thing. And many tasks could be better handled by somebody who doesn\\'t have a gun. You\\'re getting wrong, police officers are necessary. What resources the police officers are currently doing, what jobs could be better handled by different types of social workers who are unarmed that would be more effective and wouldn\\'t result in brutality and people getting needlessly shot and killed. I think there\\'s a serious conversation there and we\\'re going to discuss that more in the defense segment, but it\\'s not impossible to get unions out because just Seattle, my town, where I live, just expel the police union from the city\\'s labor group. The city labor groups are what handle the trade at the docks and all of the building permits. The unions control a lot of labor that goes on in Seattle and in every major city. Seattle just said, \"Police union, you have too much power. Take a hike.\" They could do that. I didn\\'t know they could do that, but they just did it. It\\'s super cool. It\\'s wild. It\\'s super, super crazy. These are unprecedented in times for so many reasons. Yeah. So let\\'s talk about CHOP, Capitol Hill. It\\'s also called CHAZ, Autonomous Zone, which is not accurate from when Annie and I went there. The majority of people there prefer CHOP, the Capitol Hill Occupi protest. Like Occupy Wall Street. That\\'s what they\\'re doing there is they were occupying an area. They were making it so it can\\'t be used for the functions that it\\'s normally used because people are mad. Yeah. So Braden, what have you heard about it, man? Yeah, I mean, I remember when I first started hearing about it, I was like, \"What is happening?\" Like it was just wild to me. Very radical concept. And saw a lot of different posts and articles about it both for and against the idea. And then I also saw a lot of posts from friends or friends of friends in Seattle who were giving their own accounts and firsthand accounts. And those were also some that were both positive or negative. And even seeing it go from CHAZ to CHOP, there was news articles about that. Well, now it\\'s not CHAZ anymore. I have a friend who I used to work with and she lives there. And I texted her about it because she told me a few weeks ago during the protests, and I was asking her how I was going that because they were literally marching below her window. Right. And they were still using tear gas at one point. And she sent her-- Are you pulling into her windows? Yeah. She saw people get tear gassed and she was trying to help people get milk. She was handing down milk so that people could flush it out, which is wild in itself. But she experienced that. But she said just opening her window and she didn\\'t realize that it was just in the air. Just the tear gas was just in the air and it got in her bowl and it was just like-- And it affected her not as bad, obviously. So she realized how potent that is and how-- It\\'s a war crime for a reason. Yeah. How much that must suck to get it sprayed directly to your face. And anyway, so there\\'s all that that\\'s been going on. But then now-- So I texted her updates when I saw about CHAZ and CHOP. I asked her how that was going and she said it\\'s very uncertain. She\\'s like she\\'s supportive of the movement and the protests and you know, but she also lives there and there are also people who maybe don\\'t have the right intentions who are coming in there and she\\'s just a little-- Ah, yeah. There we go. So she\\'s a little nervous. Rightfully, I think. That\\'s a super important point. Yes. So yeah, she\\'s a little nervous just because she owns her own there and what\\'s going to happen is she\\'s like there\\'s graffiti everywhere. Some of it is beautiful. Some of it is beautiful. But there\\'s a lot of ugly, unnecessary graffiti as well. But she said-- but yeah, she said what a lot of people are saying, the first-hand accounts I\\'ve seen anyway that it\\'s for the most part, very peaceful and fine. But she\\'s curious to see what\\'s going to happen long term. Right, right, right. It\\'s super weird that once the police in the right gear with the weapons leave, it\\'s peaceful. It\\'s super crazy, isn\\'t it? It\\'s odd how that happens. Yeah, and she was thankful for the ban on tear gas in the city. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we\\'re going to talk about the city council meeting here in a second. We actually have a couple of audio clips to play for listeners. So what\\'s something that\\'s frustrating is, is CHOP is super complicated and there\\'s a lot going on there. And it is absolutely necessary for the media from all sides of the political spectrum to misrepresent this. And it is absolutely necessary for the police force of Seattle as well as the mayor and the police chief to misrepresent what\\'s going on in CHOP in order to justify the aggression that was shown towards these protesters. And in order to increase funding and increase their weaponry and increase everything, because we have an autonomous one, we have a chunk of the city that\\'s fallen into anarchy and shits on fire everywhere. And we have to do something, we have to bump us up in your priority list, President Trump, because we got shit going down here. So it\\'s incumbent. It\\'s necessary for basically all media to misrepresent what\\'s going on in CHOP, which means that that\\'s going on in CHOP. That\\'s going on in every goddamn protest across the nation. Like Fox News showed a picture of the Minneapolis Fire or Minneapolis Police Department burning overlaid when they were talking a story about CHOP as if that\\'s what happened in CHOP. But it\\'s not. The police just boarded it up and came in with moving trucks and just left. They just left it wasn\\'t, it wasn\\'t set on fire. It wasn\\'t they didn\\'t burn to the ground. It was just, they just boarded it up and now there\\'s graffiti and there\\'s murals all around all of the windows that are boarded up. There\\'s murals to the people who have died by police brutality. And there\\'s no more aggression there. There is no more violence. And I can\\'t say that unequivocally because unfortunately some stupid ass motherfuckers are coming in and saying, Oh, it\\'s the purge here in CHOP. I\\'m going to do whatever the fuck I want. And just yesterday, just last night, a couple of people were shot by an unarmed per an unmarked white pickup truck person in an unmarked white pickup truck. Two people, two protesters were shot in CHOP and these people aren\\'t like rioting and yelling and they\\'re people who are just like building a community there, right? They\\'ve set up like swap stations for clothing and for food and for all necessities. They have medical stations. They have everything that you need. They have people walking around who are collecting the trash and taking it out of the zone. Like it\\'s a functioning community. Just it\\'s a normal functioning community except there aren\\'t cars driving through it because it\\'s shut down. They have the roads barricaded and there aren\\'t cops there, right? So two people got shot and there\\'s disagreements about what exactly happened there because one of the people just bled out when they called an ambulance, the people who apparently called the ambulance said that the ambulance refused to come into the area and said that they are unable to come into the area because the streets are blocked but the protesters themselves are saying that they said that they wouldn\\'t come into the area no matter where they brought the people. Even if they brought the people the whole two blocks outside of the zone, they carried the people who were dying two blocks outside of the zone to be picked up by the ambulance. They\\'re saying that no matter where they took the people that the ambulance wouldn\\'t show up, right? So there\\'s conflicting accounts of what exactly happened here. Personally, I\\'m inclined to side a little more with the protesters here because I don\\'t find police trustworthy. I simply don\\'t find any reason to believe anything that police officers are saying right now and police officers and let\\'s say firefighters, ambulance drivers, they\\'re not the same organizations but crossing that thin blue line is that you don\\'t do that to your brothers, right? So let\\'s get some misconceptions out of the way. The autonomous zone, there has been this widespread effort to create lies about CHOP, that there\\'s food scarcity, that there\\'s chaos going on, that there are people walking around and shooting people, that there are armed dudes walking around with the assault rifles. It\\'s a second amendment, they can do that if they want. But by and large, these are all completely not true. There is no food scarcity going on, there is no chaos going on, it\\'s very calm. People like they have a stage there where they have a steady string of people who are giving speeches and then the people are sitting down like watching documentaries at night. It\\'s a very peaceful zone. There are stupid motherfuckers walking around with assault rifles who are quickly chased out of the zone by the protesters because a lot of them are white supremacist assholes who are anarchists and want to see the world burn. Just walking around with their guns because they think that it\\'s super cool to do that and they\\'re trying to keep the peace and it\\'s still order and it\\'s like, no, you\\'re literally the problem here. Like you\\'re literally the problem, the proud boys. There are also black people who are walking around with guns who are trying to be the police officers of CHOP and the people who are leading the protest, the people who are giving their speeches are like, you\\'re literally becoming the embodiment of everything that you hate that has caused a side-on rest here. You\\'re becoming the overly aggressive police officer that these whole protests are created to dismantle. So there\\'s a lot of self-regulating going on in the autonomous zone, right? It\\'s autonomous only in name. It\\'s an occupation. It\\'s not an autonomous zone, right? The people didn\\'t secede from the US. They just want to use CHOP as leverage to make Seattle better, which has been demonstrated that it\\'s becoming effective. Local businesses, they\\'re booming right now. They\\'re not drying up. They\\'re not being rated. They\\'re not having their windows smashed in. Local businesses are doing a ton of business. They\\'re doing extremely well right now. There aren\\'t people standing at the borders into the CHOP and checking IDs and making sure people aren\\'t cops. There\\'s none of that going on. People can come and go freely. When Annie and I went, we basically went as tourists to see what was going on. One of the people who gave a speech said, \"If you\\'re coming here as a tourist, you\\'re not welcome here.\" If you\\'re walking around like this is a block party with a beer, you\\'re not welcome here. You\\'re not contributing to actually do something. You\\'re not here to do anything other than just see what\\'s going on. You\\'re not welcome in this place. Annie and I weren\\'t welcome. We were there as tourists, but they didn\\'t chase us out. We stood there for a couple of hours and watched speakers. We went and looked at all of the street art at the graffiti. There\\'s a library there. People just laid out a bunch of books, a bunch of diverse and important books, even children\\'s books. There\\'s people just hanging out and smoking weed. It\\'s not a party. The organizers are very emphatic that this is not a party. This is an occupation. This is what we are doing to give us leverage to actually be effective in our bargaining here. There\\'s been rumors of fires. I think there have been a couple of small fires that have happened. No buildings have burned down. No mass destruction has happened. None of the businesses have had all of their windows smashed out. The businesses are there. The businesses that are particularly in the service industry there, they\\'re doing great business and they love the protesters and they\\'ve given them a lot of money. They enjoy it. Restaurants, residents, everybody\\'s happy there. People are still paying sales and property taxes, even though they\\'re in this autonomous zone. They\\'re still complying with laws. It\\'s basically a street fare, but it\\'s like not. It\\'s an occupation. It is used as leverage. That\\'s what Annie and I saw. There has been some violence that has happened there, but little examples of dudes walking around with guns or people getting in a fight there is blown way out of proportion and it\\'s being used by the media to characterize it as that\\'s all that\\'s going on is it\\'s just a constant 24 hours of unrest. There\\'s raiding, there\\'s pillaging, there\\'s murder, there\\'s rape, there\\'s just all the atrocities, there\\'s just pure barbarity in this zone and all of it is complete fabrication. All of it is the media, characteristically lying to sell an narrative. Yeah. I mean, as a designer, as someone who\\'s used Photoshop, I thought it was hilarious when they photoshopped. I saw the side by side of an actual photo from shop and then a photoshopped, just like a poorly done Photoshop of a guy, just like a camera exactly how you look, but a more menacing writer type figure placed just over top that image like in the foreground and it was just hilarious. Right. And it was a black guy too, right? It was a black guy when the majority of people in chop are white right now. The protests, the occupation is being led by black people, but it\\'s almost all white people who are sitting there and listening to the speeches because Capitol Hill is super fucking white, dude. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been there before, but it\\'s super duper gentrified white neighborhood. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because it\\'s just, it\\'s like, I mean, it\\'s around like Cal Anderson Park, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And been there several times and yeah, it\\'s like, I remember seeing like the tennis court there, it was like, it was like a group of hipsters, which, you know, that maybe that\\'s a derogatory term for some, but they were, they were, they were playing, they were on bikes playing like, like, like polo on horses, you know, like croquet on a tennis court. And I was like this. There was like 20 of them and it was like a club league or something. I was like, this is a thing. They\\'re like playing polo on their bikes. Yeah. Were they like wearing flannel polo shirts and a scarf? Yeah. You know, they\\'re flannels and they\\'re mustaches and they\\'re fixed geared bikes. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And there was probably a case of PBR nearby and absolutely not a stereotype, but, but yeah, there is a line band stereotype. It is, it is interesting that yeah, Capitol Hill, it\\'s a very, I mean, it\\'s, you know, a very white area and, but also a friendly area as far as I experienced. Yeah. It\\'s super important because the history of Capitol Hill, like, and any and I had no idea about this, but like the, the year that I moved up here, we went to the North American African or the, uh, Northwestern African American museum here in Seattle and I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been there, but it\\'s unfortunately a tragically underfunded museum, but they had a special exhibit when we went there and it was talking about, uh, basically a small group of individuals of folks who basically built Capitol Hill, beginning in the very late 1800s and into the early 1900s. Capitol Hill was a black community, dude. It was a black grassroots community and it was built off of, you know, recently freed slaves coming out of the reconstruction era and the era of good feelings. And it was like they were, they were actually like black people were like elected to offices and stuff and like, and people were building houses with their bare hands and like they put so much time and effort into building Capitol Hill up. And then the dot com boom came and text are coming into Seattle and the area immediately became white people moving into the area, hiking up the property values and all of the black people had to move out because they couldn\\'t afford taxes. They couldn\\'t afford their houses anymore. The houses they built with their own hands that, that had been in their family for two to three generations. They could no longer afford to live in their own houses, even though they owned them outright. And like Capitol Hill, because it\\'s such a, like the, the history of racism in Capitol Hill itself makes it the perfect epicenter to have this occupation movement. It\\'s truly remarkable. Wow. So one thing that\\'s super cool about chop two is it completely breaks people\\'s brains because it\\'s an occupation that doesn\\'t have a leader, right? So Mayor Durkin, police chief Carmen Best came in to chop. This was this happened last week. They came in trying to find somebody to bargain with, to negotiate because chop has three demands. One, no more tear gas, which they, that\\'s, well, that\\'s in the works right now. It\\'s sort of happening. And if you\\'re on the police, number two, and number three, release all protesters that have been arrested. That\\'s super duper simple. Three very simple demands. And from what I\\'ve seen, it looks like the demands list has since grown, but the mayor and the police chief came into town and it came into chop and we\\'re looking for people to negotiate with. And they\\'re like, there\\'s, there\\'s nobody here to negotiate with. We\\'re not here to negotiate. You meet our demands. That\\'s super duper simple, right? You meet the demands and then we\\'re done. We\\'re done here. Defend the police, stop using police brutality and you release the protesters. No questions asked. We are not moving on those demands. And because there is no sole person at the head of the organization, there is nobody who is leading the protests. It\\'s a coalition of a whole bunch of different people. It\\'s decentralized occupation. That means there\\'s nobody that the police or the CIA or the FBI can shoot and assassinate. There\\'s nobody that they can lock up and tie up in court battles for five years like Angela Davis. There\\'s, there\\'s nobody that they can, that they can make their enemy. There\\'s nobody that they can negotiate with. It\\'s completely decentralized, which means that all that Seattle can do is acquiesce to the demands or act, we ask to some of the demands or show movement show not only agreeing to demands, which have so often been reneged on in American history with whether it\\'s Native American, whether it\\'s African American, whether it\\'s any minority group. It\\'s not agreed to the demands and then we\\'ll see what happens. It\\'s you show good faith effort and meet demands or we\\'re staying. We\\'re staying here and it breaks conventions. It breaks people\\'s brains, right? Cause there\\'s that occupy Wall Street, what 2010 or 2011? When was that or 2012? Yeah, it\\'s, it\\'s been a while. I don\\'t remember, but that sounds about right. Yeah. I think it was 12 and people were like so mad and they\\'re, and once again, it was completely decentralized, but there was no demands. There were no actions. It was like, give the money to the people. There were no solid rock solid demands to acquiesce to and they didn\\'t successfully shut down Wall Street. They just had a big block party, right? And for like a week and a half and everybody went home and guess what? Nothing fucking changed. Chop is different. Chop is absolutely different because it\\'s not just, it\\'s not just income inequality. It\\'s race inequality. It\\'s completely decentralized and it\\'s a small tight area that can be very tightly controlled that simply says we are not, there\\'s no negotiating happening here. You change. So let\\'s talk about change that\\'s happened in Seattle. Yeah. And those are three very simple, easily achievable demands. Yeah. They\\'re not asking a lot. No. That\\'s, and because chop has been such a, it\\'s a power move, right? You\\'re using a chunk of a city as leverage against your city counselors, right? Like that\\'s a hell of a lot of leverage. The discussions are no longer about whether or not the police would be defunded. It\\'s to what extent and where is that money going, right? Like the discussions are no longer about what demands or how much are we going to meet the demands of bands. The discussions are, okay, the demands will be met. We just have to figure out the logistics of them and get bills passed. So let\\'s talk about Seattle City Council because this just passed or this was just last week. I believe this happened on the 16th, the 16th of June 2020. And I actually brought a few audio clips here that we can, I think we need to talk about and they\\'re kind of long, but they\\'re super important because it reveals the mechanisms of government and why it\\'s goddamn important to get involved. Okay. So there were three bills in front of Seattle City Council. No. One, ban choke holds. No. Two, morning bands that are covering police badge numbers. Those are the bands that police officers wear when they\\'re mourning the fallen officer. Police officers were, had those morning bands over their badge numbers during the riots. If you\\'re mourning a fallen police officer, maybe not in the middle of a riot so that, you know, if you, you know, hit somebody in the head or you shoot them with a rubber bullet or if you shoot them in the face with a tear gas canister or let\\'s say, you know, just push them backwards and they fall and crack their head on the pavement and they have brain damage and they\\'re partially paralyzed for the rest of their short life. But we can figure out who you are. There has to be transparency there for effective policing. So morning bands, it makes it so that becomes illegal and the third bill tear gas and riot control, no more riot control weapons, no more of those. So three simple bills, banning choke holds, banning morning bands and banning tear gas and riot control less than lethal weapons. So let\\'s start with a counselor, so on. So on proposed the bill that would ban choke holds would ban the morning bands and ban the tear gas and riot control. She was the sponsor. She was the creator of the bill and let\\'s take a second to listen to what she has to say about a high level overview about the bill. Flora is yours. Thank you, President Salas. I appreciate that the bill that\\'s under consideration now from our movement and from our office, bans the city from owning and the police from using crowd control weapons like tear gas, nays, blast balls, flash banks, plastic bullets and other weapons that are typically used indiscriminately on gatherings of protesters. Some of these weapons like tear gas have been banned for decades from use in war by the Geneva Convention and yet the mayor of Seattle, Jenny Durkin and Seattle police under her control have repeatedly on a daily basis used them since the George Floyd protests began on May 30th against the people of Seattle. As we\\'ve discussed before, many of us have witnessed it, many of us have experienced it in the members of the public and for days the Seattle police department used these weapons on the streets of Capitol Hill. They falsely claimed that the protesters were violent writers and that they had no alternative that is absolutely untrue. I mean, it could not be more untrue. They have even attempted to maintain those lives in the face of video evidence showing us that the police were the source and the sole source of violence and that they were not quote unquote responding to any situation, but that they were there with the intention of inflicting violence. So this is Councilor Suwan. I mean, obviously she\\'s on top of her game. She knows what\\'s going on. She proposed the bill. She was there in chop when it was when they successfully took over, right? She saw what happened first hand. She was somebody who got tear gassed. She saw this. She very quickly dismantles the police union arguments that these are the protesters that want to are inciting violence. She just handles it perfectly well. She introduces the bill and says this we absolutely need to pass this and these are war crimes that the police officers are perpetrating on citizens. Now, yeah, let\\'s listen to audio clip two because I think this is even more important to highlight what was going on in the city council meeting. Okay. We have evidence that the police were source of the violence even further now because after the mounting public outrage eventually forced Mayor Jenny Durkin to pull the police back from the streets of Capitol Hill, the violence has left with them. There is nobody there with riot gear, armed to the hill with all kinds of equipment and chemical weapons. There\\'s no such thing. Only the police have them here in Seattle and around the country demonstrators have been grievously injured by these weapons and an open letter signed by over a thousand medical professionals has explained that weapons like tear gas and mace significantly increase the danger of COVID. Of course. We need to ban these weapons which have been misused against protests for decades. The police and the political establishment simply cannot be trusted with them. Seattle police might argue that without tear gas rubber bullets and blast walls, they will use even more lethal even more lethal weapons against the demonstrators. We have to completely reject this dangerous argument. The purpose of this legislation is to prevent the police from meeting protests with any violence whatsoever. If the Seattle police instead show up with more lethal weaponry, that would be absolutely devastating and disastrous. But that would only, and I hope that doesn\\'t happen, but that would only prove the point that this Black Lives Matter movement is making, which is that it does not work for us to have a police state. We need our community to be organized for us to keep ourselves safe and for public safety for all. If Seattle passes this legislation, it will be historic and it will be an inspiration for what movements around the country can win. But we also need to remember that this won\\'t be enough. We will need to go much farther with all the steps that I was outlining earlier, which I will reiterate once again later before passage of this bill. So what knows her stuff, immediately dismantles the police arguments that if we don\\'t have less lethal stuff, then we\\'re going to bring more lethal stuff to the protest. And she\\'s like, that is outrageous. That\\'s not helping anything. Yeah, that just that just shows how much of a police state we are in. Now a complication comes into this because we have the tear gas in the riot control weapons, you know, plastic bullets, rubber bullets, all of these less lethal, you know, quote, unquote, less lethal, but a number of people have died from them. They also increase the chance of COVID because you\\'re snorting and you\\'re crying. And of course they do, right? Well, and then people are rushing to your aid to dump milk or whatever. Yep. Yeah, exactly. There\\'s a complication because two hours and 45 minutes before the council, which was just 45 minutes before the submission deadline for amendments, counselor her bolt added an amendment which created a loophole in the tear gas and rubber bullets bill. This loophole was noticed by counselor so want who was sypharously objected to it. Just wanted to quickly say that in terms of making sure that the public is on the same page as us in terms of understanding the process. At some point council member her bolts amendment will be considered which on the face of it claims that all it\\'s doing is clarifying what is what is what is what is crowd control that it is simply intended to say that the legislation does not apply to non crowd control situations. But what it will actually do is create giant truck sized loopholes that will allow the use of these weapons in virtually any situation. The problem is that Seattle police will abuse those loopholes. Look at what happened after the mayor\\'s much publicized 30 day OC ban. Seattle police to report one of the public commenters simply do not have the track record that should lead us to believe that we can trust them to not use weapons on peaceful protest. We heard testimony from Bettina who said a woman took a flash bang grenade in the chest and almost died and had to be revived with multiple CPR routines. That\\'s a really important example of why in my view it would be horrific to pass council member her bolts amendment because it brings up the question of what kind of society do we want to be. We absolutely you know it will be sending a message to the people of Seattle whether that amendment is passed or not which side the council is actually on and whether the council is actually doing everything in its power to prevent such occurrences and to prevent such violence. I have more points on the amendment that council member her bolt has which I hope that she just withdraws. I honestly am I\\'m being very honest. I I hope that council member her bolt has taken too hard the incredibly powerful public testimony that we have heard and that she puts that in front of her and and understand that we cannot you know we cannot have politicians co-op the language the vocabulary of movement and say we\\'re going to reimagine the police and we\\'re going to dismantle the police and then refuse to do the bare minimum. I really hope council member her bolt withdraws her amendment and that we are able to as a city council unanimously pass this legislation. So the language that councilor her bolts introduced basically said that the police officers cannot use the tear gas grenades for any crowd dispersal measures and it came with tear gas grenades, rubber bullets, sonic devices and all crowd control stuff. They can\\'t use it for dispersing crowds but they can use it for non crowd dispersal purposes. Which if we understand the track record of police officers they can say huh your car smells like weed get out. I\\'m going to put you in handcuffs and I\\'m going to search it and then they put some fucking weed in your car body cam body cam footage shows a ton of that right like we can\\'t trust police officers with loopholes like this. Councilor so want noticed that this loophole was crafted in councilor her bolts amendment which councilor her bolt submitted only 45 minutes before the submission deadline for amendments. Hoping they wouldn\\'t catch it hoping that it wouldn\\'t be caught. So councilor so want somebody who was on the front lines in chop who got tear gas herself noticed this one tiny line and seriously it was there were multiple sections to the amendment proposed by her bowl. It was a single line it was a subsection C of subsection five of amendment three. She noticed that one tiny line in there that created the loophole that rendered the bill completely meaningless and if she didn\\'t catch it then her bolts amendment would have been passed and the law would be useless. And it be reported in the media. Oh so great. Seattle bands tear gas and bands sonic weapons and bands but it would all be fake. It would all be inaccurate right. So any and I of course like prior to this we you know we both send an email to our counselors and said you know because obviously their their voicemails are full still but we send an email to the counselors and said we urge you to vote to pass these measures and they all passed unanimously that amendment proposed by herbal just 45 minutes before the submission deadline was removed it was stricken and so on strong language there was very clear I hope counselor herbald just withdraws this because so on could see what the fuck was happening the police unions got a line built into the amendment. It\\'s that little tiny shit that makes politics go round right where not because how often does that happen how often console constantly every bill every amendment everything someone do slipping something in for some reason or for someone else\\'s benefit or their own benefit and it\\'s just so shady no to do it so obviously like wait until almost literally the last minute down to the last hour hoping that this however many pages it is that they wouldn\\'t have enough enough time to skim it or go over it with enough detail with enough of a fine tooth comb to find that one sentence that made the whole thing pointless it\\'s just so backwards and right it really you know it makes you wonder why so many people have distrust for the government does it politicians doesn\\'t adjust because like dude you and I we\\'re not on city council like we\\'re not you know we\\'re not in Congress we\\'re not in state Congress we\\'re not at the federal level in Congress like we don\\'t see the bills and most people who are you know most Congress people don\\'t actually read the bills that they pass they just know where their party is going to come out on the bill they know their constituents are more D or more are and they\\'re going to vote whatever way on that bill that the partisan system tells them to vote I mean the omnibus bill was a thousand pages not a single senator read that thing right like and that was how the government spends the whole goddamn money all year like none of them read the omnibus bill like nobody goes through with a fine tooth comb and there are so many interest groups who get little tiny words little tiny sentences little amendments put in here and you know each of those bills each of those sentences each of those little things they\\'re butterfly effects man so notably as well there are a couple points that I want to talk about with the Seattle City Council meeting you know and Annie and I watched the three hours of it like we sat here diligently is Seattle citizens watching the city council meeting and a lot of it was stuff we didn\\'t care about because it was like a gig economy and comes and it\\'s like that\\'s not us right now so we don\\'t care it\\'ll be us in a few years but not right now it\\'s not the protest stuff or so we\\'re not paying attention right all these bills passed unanimously but all of them had provisions every single one of them had labor unions in the bills so basically that they have to put the bills into effect but that the labor unions will be basically have a seat at the table they will be consulted as to how to implement the bills which means Seattle City Council passed the bills but the police unions have a say in how the bills work once they\\'re passed once they\\'re implemented which luckily for us Seattle just basically said the police unions you don\\'t you don\\'t have you\\'re not in the city labor groups so sorry take a hike so luckily I guess those though I am not sure exactly how that is impacts the three bills that were passed how that works I honestly don\\'t know there\\'s just a lot in the air there\\'s a lot of conversations that are going on that like Brad when we call our senators or we call even our city councilors and their voicemail boxes are full it\\'s not because you and people like you and me are calling them they\\'re spending all the time talking to other people in politics right like that\\'s why their voicemail boxes are full because the people the police unions are calling them national nationwide police unions are calling these people and saying you got to do this you got to pass this bill you got to make sure you add this language you got to do like that\\'s who they\\'re inundated with so the people who are the real constituents people like you and me the real citizens who actually check that person\\'s name in the voting card you and I never get a talk to them we never get a meeting with them we would they\\'ll never make the time for us right and that\\'s that happens at every level of government right notably as well the council president said this after they passed the bill banning tear gas and rubber bullets and sonic weapons she said in passing the bill doesn\\'t include provisions of how to liquidate the city\\'s current stock of those items just that they can\\'t use them and then she said nonchalantly I guess that\\'s a conversation we\\'ll have later what\\'s gonna happen to what the tens of thousands of tear gas grenades the hundreds of thousands of rubber bullet rounds that they have the the sonic guns that they have that mount on the back of a Humvee all of the tanks all the riot control stuff what\\'s gonna happen to it because I am pretty damn sure that there are 150 other massive cities in America who are running pretty low on supplies who are gonna pay a fucking premium for those things so by the time the city council reconvenes and has a new bill about how to liquidate and dispose of this stuff who knows where it\\'s all going to be right it\\'s it\\'s creating a black market among the police unions and the various police departments for all of these riot control gear that are now going to be trading at a premium because other countries have stopped their exporting of these chemicals to America so all we got is just our current stocks and we\\'re gonna deplete them in more and more protests that are still going on all across America right now yeah she\\'s that wild so many things to think about how this affects God thank you counselor so want for catching that yep thank you thank you because this is just talking about Seattle imagine where this is going on where they\\'re trying to do this all over the country and and where this is going on everywhere else in the country and people are not watching the city council conversations they\\'re not calling their city counselors they\\'re not calling their congresspeople they\\'re marching through the streets and catching coronavirus people are paying attention to their twitter feeds and their other social media which is all their friends and all their content creators and all their talking heads talking about stuff where the the real change is happening right before our eyes and the way that it changes is dependent on how much we pay attention to where the change actually happens so if we don\\'t pay attention to the city council stuff if we don\\'t you know go and attend city council meetings and and you know during public discussion have those conversations and send emails to them prior to the meetings and we don\\'t if we don\\'t pay attention to where the change is happening the change happens without our knowledge and change obviously right in front of us societal change has evolved and adapted and become what it is apparently in such ways to suppress certain people because of their fucking skin color or because of their income right because like you and me we don\\'t we haven\\'t bought and paid for politicians like we\\'re not getting meetings with them but i assure you that you know like the various lobbying groups they\\'re getting all the meetings with Mitch McConnell and senator Warren and and uh you know Matt Gaetz and Bernie Sanders and all of our favorite politicians they\\'re getting the meetings with the lobbyists with the people who are proposing bills and handing them pre-filled out bills and it all happens without us knowing a damn thing about it and we wonder why society is so fucked up yeah that\\'s actually a really great point that because of you know a lot of our focus on social media right now there\\'s just a lot of thoughts and a lot of good ideas and a lot of interesting points people are making but there\\'s not a lot out there as far as action it\\'s right as things that can be done it\\'s forts in the wind man it\\'s not there\\'s nothing to it right people are educating themselves that\\'s good that\\'s an action people are you know calling senators or emailing their you know local police departments to try to change you know the ban what was the uh was it eight camp eight can wait yeah eight can\\'t wait eight can\\'t wait you know like that you know getting in touch with your local you know police department in law enforcement to try to change how they do how they practice law how they do things and but as far as bills getting passed as far as everything there\\'s there\\'s just so much that just goes by and goes over our heads because we\\'re all just focused on the message and not on how to change the outcome right it feels good to protest it feels good to go out there and walk in a sea in a mass of people and things are happening because exactly exactly that\\'s leverage that activists need to push forward change right if not for the protest we wouldn\\'t have chopped if not for chop we wouldn\\'t have Seattle City Council passing these bills if not for chop we wouldn\\'t have the Seattle City Council booting the the police labor unions in implementing these new laws we wouldn\\'t like we wouldn\\'t have this change without the bodies in the street the bodies in the street are one facet of activism that is necessary to societal change translating the bodies in the street into leverage for actual bills to pass or actual things to happen that\\'s the next step and and if there aren\\'t people working at all of these necessary levels societal change doesn\\'t happen we just get protests right so then this this brings us to a central point of slogans and buzzwords that people are saying defund the police right what are you where are what do you know what are your thoughts on defund police well i mean just those two words alone it causes you know it\\'s very it\\'s very striking phrase yeah it\\'s discomforting it\\'s very discomforting and it causes an immediate reaction and and it sounds scary quite honestly it\\'s very it sounds very extreme and even to me and to a lot of people obviously they see they just see defund the police and it\\'s freak out you know but that that means there makes sense any cops who\\'s going to shoot the robbers and rapists right it sounds very extreme it sounds like remove police that\\'s i think that\\'s what a lot of people think get rid of police no more police it\\'s the purge time no more police yeah and that\\'s not what it is and it\\'s right about changing the police\\'s behavior changing where those funds are allocated changing you know what types of calls police respond to right um you know and and how they\\'re funded and and just reprioritizing you know those funds to different things whether it\\'s you know educating them or their health care or mental health services or you know different community programs and that was something that um was it something counselors want said you know changing how the community reacts to these you know focusing on the community was something something that would benefit this movement and i\\'m kind of i don\\'t know defund the police gets your attention but i think it distracts it detracts from the message honestly and it in a kind of uh i don\\'t know i wish they chose chosen to better slow better slogan maybe but these these decisions aren\\'t made they just organically happen right yeah exactly that\\'s true there was no one that just said we\\'re going with this one right anyway so that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s what i think about it i it does sound extreme but obviously changes need to happen and extreme changes need to happen extreme changes and it will make things better just because this is how policing has been done doesn\\'t mean it\\'s been done correctly it\\'s obviously not been done correctly whatever correct needs is if there\\'s an objective correct policing right yes it needs to be disrupted and if you hear defund the police and that scares you then have a conversation and start talking about or or could change turn on tucker Carlson and be more afraid of the world uh that ass hat yeah that\\'s those are your choices i guess right well that\\'s that\\'s a that\\'s a really crucial point here is because the people who need to hear the the nuances of defund the police the most are the people who are being deliberately fed the most lies yeah right yeah i i just you know everything is so divisive and and it\\'s hard to see things be so divisive and you sometimes you just want to knock some sense into people and just be like it\\'s not that extreme like they\\'re we can find a way that we still have police but then they don\\'t shoot people with mental illnesses that are harmless you know like the because like very few situations that police officers respond to our best solved with the taser or you know standard issue barretta nine millimeter right right and just think about even just me um a couple months ago i got pulled over um just a very simple traffic stop and just how nervous i was right well for no reason i had there was no re it wasn\\'t rational you know but here\\'s a cop with a badge and a gun on his hip and if i say the wrong thing if i you know get heated or like is he gonna ask me to step out of my car and if i step out of my car like what\\'s going on how\\'s it gonna escalate from there and dude and like you\\'re a white guy you\\'re white guy saying that shit i know you\\'re not even somebody who grew up with the the understood not not the narrative but the understanding of the reality of how much your skin color increases your chances of being shot in that interaction like if white people are skittish around cops imagine what it\\'s like being a black person around a cop holy shit oh my god and you wonder why why unarmed black man run from cops and then get shot in the back like you wonder why that happens because they\\'re already so skittish to begin with right right right fight a flight fight a flight fight a flight flight or freeze yeah so yeah those are my thoughts on the the defund the police well yeah simply put it\\'s complicated right right it is and people view it different ways too like some people say as abolishing the police right um other seat is just like a dramatic reduction or a slight reduction in police um like but the police abolition movement predates defund pd by five decades right but essentially put simply the billions of dollars that america pours into police departments every year could obviously be better used by well-trained unarmed social workers cops are trained to use lethal and less lethal solutions to every problem but very few solutions that arise in communities are solved with lethal and less lethal solutions everything\\'s a nail when you\\'re a goddamn hammer but sometimes the situation isn\\'t a fucking nail right all right so portland just cut 15 million dollars from their police budget of nearly a half a billion dollars every year wow that\\'s that\\'s nothing that\\'s cutting over time pay for 15 officers for half the year that\\'s fucking nothing right um miniapolis is currently in discussions about defunding the police uh seattle is taking steps to defund a few million dollars you know still conversations are happening all of these things are these defundings are very marginal improvements um and we\\'re only talking about fractions of budgets that for large uh municipal precincts for large like seattle new york whatever a lot of these are in excess of half a billion to a billion dollars a year right um so what this means is like taking out little thimble fools from these oceans these defundings are only ceremonial and they\\'re only good optics they at the end of the day they don\\'t actually accomplish any of the goals of the defund movement right which sucks because we can say oh we did defund the police we cut 15 million dollars from portland\\'s police department budget it\\'s like come on man you know their budget is like 407 million dollars a year that\\'s that\\'s nothing that is nothing that\\'s laying off three officers they\\'re like seriously yeah but you know sometimes my optimistic mind kicks in and it\\'s okay it\\'s 15 million this year let\\'s say they see an improvement let\\'s say they see a reduction in police brutality and they see an increase in you know positive statements from interactions with the police or the social workers because of the budget change or you know if that money goes to community programs and they see the positive change in that in the community that there\\'s a lower crime rate and then the next year or five years from now it\\'s not 15 million cut from the police budget but it\\'s 100 million from the police budget and then in 10 years it\\'s you know 200 million you know it\\'s it is a step in the right direction but yeah it\\'ll be maybe maybe i\\'m being overly optimistic right and i was going to say you\\'re entitled to your optimism i don\\'t think it\\'s warranted right like these are you know society has an arterial bleeding wound right now and these are these are band-aids these are band-aids to fix broken bones and you know lesions and and gouges that are causing society to lose consciousness one i\\'m i\\'m for it right like i\\'m for a massive overhaul of the way that society takes care of itself and that means my personal slogan isn\\'t necessarily defund the PD or defund police it is fundamental health you fund mental health you cut down on crime you fund uh family programs and you make it so people don\\'t have to resort to crime to put food on the table crime goes down like you\\'re still going to have criminals you\\'re still going to have deranged minds that commit crimes you\\'re still going to have serial killers right but the percentage of people who are committing crimes out of necessity of feeding themselves and feeding their families far outweighs the psychopaths and sociopaths right i mean i i don\\'t know the statistics on this of course right because it\\'s such a it\\'s such murky waters that i\\'m and broad terms and general categories that i\\'m using here but i mean the number of crazy you know legitimately criminally crazy people who just want to commit crimes and do so to cause harm to inflict harm that\\'s a tiny tiny tiny percentage of the american population in spite of news and media telling you that those people are constantly trying to kill you and constantly looking to kill your family and and you know they\\'re all you know if as as soon as they get into the country they\\'re gonna you know rape all the white women right so yeah as much as those narratives are sold to us they\\'re just not true the people who are committing crimes because they have to is that that\\'s almost all of them right and the people who are incarcerated for the crimes far outweighs minorities uh far outweigh the number of people who are incarcerated who are not minorities who are white right so there\\'s some major problems to deal with here um so i for one say fundamental health i think that\\'s a much better way to approach this and it\\'s not such a scary slogan but defund police is a scary enough slogan that it shocks people into having a conversation so we can\\'t ignore the power and the utility of defund the police um defund the police starts the conversations fundamental health i think is a is a great way to help package and help to help sell defund police because you\\'re taking the funds from police you got to put them somewhere mental health mental health that\\'s super simple that reduces the homeless problem that reduces crime problems that reduces incarceration problems that reduces so many problems in society drug addictions drug addictions alcohol addictions and abuse like it\\'s i love that i i love that shift and i mean it\\'s it\\'s the it\\'s the same idea yeah it\\'s just flipping the narrative and flipping the you know it changes your reaction totally the difference in reaction from defund police to fundamental health is huge and um yeah that\\'s definitely something i could i could get behind yeah um and i want to say i\\'m not saying that in a way to abandon defund police because i i don\\'t think it should be abandoned i think it\\'s a necessary ingredient into starting the conversations yes but it\\'s but it\\'s the same principle exactly it\\'s shift a large portion of the police budget to supporting mental health and improving mental health in our country right and and like um especially social workers especially public defenders especially you know to bolstering the the tired and overworked court system to getting more fair judgments for real crimes um and and funding mental health to make it so people will commit less crimes to begin with um and just funding things in very simple things in society that are going to lead for massively better outcomes but unfortunately what sucks about this is these are societal changes that are generational and systemic that you can pour trillions of dollars into quote-unquote mental health or into quote-unquote social security uh the program of you know social security and you know creating a social safety netter universal basic income you can pour trillions of dollars into those things and you may not see the benefits of them for decades to come which means it\\'s super unappealing for a political system that works on a four two four six-year election cycle nobody\\'s thinking that far ahead nobody\\'s thinking that far ahead right so while we\\'re in the conversation of dramatically reforming society I have another proposal that maybe you should begin conversation why does this reformation stop at defund police why not defund politics and this gets to the root of something that we\\'ve kind of tapped into a little bit throughout the whole conversation here today because of the citizens united ruling in 2010 corporations are people and money equals votes until those propositions are no longer the case the world will continue to be moved moved and swayed by a few wealthy groups and that means that grassroots movements the small community movements chop and all of the list of people who should have had a seat at the table for Trump\\'s executive order they\\'re never going to make it you know any of the bills that they propose any of the societal reforms that they propose they\\'re never going to make it to the federal of the nationwide level because as soon as they move beyond the municipal level beyond the Seattle city council and we discussed that there was already there was already corruption built into the Seattle amendments that had to be taken out by civil law right she argued against as soon as these bills that are proposed by grassroots movements move beyond the municipal level they\\'re instantly dead on arrival because the small group of donors who form the who form and shape politics in America by buying and selling politicians they control what happens elections in America are determined by the funds that are raised by the candidates right it\\'s it is fucking bonkers to me that we say that you know Amy McGrath outraged Mitch McConnell therefore she\\'s going to win the election that\\'s like what what somebody has more money therefore they are guaranteed to win the election how that\\'s buying elections that that that that\\'s because America never was a democracy this is an oligarchy this is an aristocracy and of course considering how much power Christianity has in politics in many ways America strikes a lot of theocratic tendencies this is a plutocracy this is a junta without a revolution preceding it it was built by the aristocrats it was built by the oligarchs it is contr- it it continues to be run by the oligarchs and because the citizens united in 2010 that is legally protected by the supreme courts for a true representative democracy money can\\'t be in politics which seems crazy and revolutionary and it seems impossible with how many resources government is required to control for the benefit of society you can\\'t say defund politics without running into a conversation of like well then how are the schools gonna run there\\'s there\\'s there\\'s subtle differences here and this is the same conversation with defund police well then who\\'s gonna stop all of the murders and the rapists no this this brings up a nuanced conversation government can run and it needs money to run therefore we must pay taxes but the people who are controlling that money should never benefit from controlling that money that the the concept of lobbyists to begin with is as undemocratic as any concept gets that is as anti-democratic as any other possible concept that simply you pay money to attend this senator\\'s luncheon that has a you know five thousand dollar a plate buy-in and you get to chat and chum and chew the fat with them for a couple of hours and talk about what bills you want passed what that\\'s not democracy that never was democracy and that\\'s how America has always worked so in order to accomplish this voting must be mandatory with an option to actively abstain meaning if you don\\'t want to vote you have to fill in the bubble that I abstain but voting has to be mandatory voting has to be easy and it has to be a national holiday and also there has to be state-sponsored sponsored election campaigns which means no more buying offices you tune into the government channel c-span as it is to hear whatever platform your representative has and then you choose rank choice voting your your representative your person who you like who gets the 30 second spot on c-span that you like the most government state-sponsored election campaigns is the only way to do it because if we don\\'t have that then we have buyer wins whoever\\'s got the biggest pocketbook gets the senate job right so while we\\'re talking revolutions why not talk about defunding politics yeah I love a lot what you said and something I hadn\\'t really put a lot of thought into so I don\\'t have a lot to respond to other than the when you brought up ranking politics and I know that\\'s not the major point of what you\\'re talking about but yeah rank choice of something that I\\'ve been yeah the rank ranking you know a lot of people are frustrated with the two-party system especially I fucking ate it with with the last election and then with the with the upcoming presidential election you know we\\'re both your choices aren\\'t that great or both your choice you know whereas if you had more options you could say well Trump\\'s definitely at the bottom and then here\\'s my third pick here\\'s my fourth pick you know here\\'s my second and you know it\\'s somewhere between this person and this person and I\\'m gonna put them at the top and then it\\'s well if if your number two wins hey that\\'s not so bad right but with that with this current situation it is just so frustrating so many people that I that I hear that are just like I don\\'t even want to vote because I don\\'t like either candidate right or you know or I\\'m gonna vote for this person who you know isn\\'t even in the running anymore because I don\\'t like the the two choices we have and it\\'s it\\'s just one of those things that\\'s just become so much more apparent when when you have two less than stellar options and that\\'s uh you know it\\'s uh it\\'s a giant douche or a turd sandwich right the old south bar episode uh voter die mother fucker uh and really in I want to say this very clearly anybody who looks at the current two candidates and says I\\'m not gonna vote because I don\\'t like the two either of the choices you\\'re fucking stupid okay you\\'re fucking stupid you you it is wrong it is wrong to not vote against Trump it just is it\\'s straight up wrong do you see what the fuck is happening do you see do you pay any attention to the headlines do you see societal unrest do you see every major city in America with massive protests and demonstrations do you see that more people have died of a preventable and containable pandemic right now then died on the from the Americans in world war one like that that is unconscionable that is absolutely unconscionable like if if we did like okay we have lost over 115 000 Americans at the time that we\\'re recording this and I don\\'t say Americans to be like oh they\\'re Americans this is this blue patriot blood I\\'m not saying it\\'s like to inspire patriotism or nationalism here those are both fucking stupid concepts uh but we have lost 115 000 Americans right now that is more than a quarter of the the Americans who died in world war two if there were clowns that emerged out of the sewer system and we\\'re snapping up people at a rate that in five months we lost a quarter of the Americans that we lost in four years in the greatest war the world has ever seen people wouldn\\'t say I don\\'t really think that the clown the sewer clowns are real you know I don\\'t I don\\'t I don\\'t just I you know I think it\\'s you know even if it is real the sewer clowns came from Mexico so you know it\\'s it\\'s an attack uh people would lose their fucking minds because that\\'s a tangible enemy that\\'s a physical you can see that the enemy you can see a person being snatched by a sewer clown and dragged in with a little red balloon you could see it right in front of your eyes but an invisible enemy is so much harder for people to wrap their goddamn minds around especially when the easiest way to combat that physical enemy or that that intangible enemy is by just wearing a mask it\\'s by swallowing your pride and putting on a goddamn mask the easiest enemy to fight and you do that\\'s all you gotta do it\\'s all you gotta do it\\'s so simple it\\'s so easy but no people are too prideful people are too stupid and people are moved and swayed by lies in the media so it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s just insane to me so if you don\\'t vote for for Biden um uh presumptive nominee you are contributing to the fracturing of society you are contributing to the problem you are telling immigrants and kids and cages you\\'re telling people who are dying in droves from covid you\\'re telling all people of color black brown any person of color you\\'re telling all of these groups of people to go fuck yourself because i don\\'t that biting doesn\\'t give me the burning feel goods i\\'m a bummer burning your bust he doesn\\'t give me a burning in my bosom no fuck you fuck your feelings it doesn\\'t matter if you don\\'t vote for Biden then you you are contributing to the problem it is the the the lesser of two evils it is a moral imperative to vote for the lesser of two evils and the parties are not equal the candidates are not equal stop with that argument yeah definitely not equal definitely not equal just yeah lesser of two evils yeah and i you know similarly i for people\\'s day well i\\'m voting for Biden and just hoping that he gets an awesome vice president vice president\\'s already made you know yeah right amen i i voted for war in my primary but she dropped out of the race before my ballot or my my uh ballot hit the office right i vote yeah nothing yeah yeah but i hadn\\'t thought of it much before about defunding politics or reprioritizing political funds but that\\'s definitely something i\\'m going to start thinking more and more about and i\\'m glad that you brought it up because it\\'s it\\'s a great point it\\'s and it\\'s the same thing i said when we were talking about defunding police it\\'s it\\'s not a perfect system it\\'s not working well and it\\'s not working well for you know it works very well for a small percentage of the population right but it doesn\\'t work well for a large percentage and it needs it\\'s just like police system it needs it it bakes to be disrupted it bakes to be changed it bakes for overhaul and i hope we start to figure it out and i know a lot of people are single-minded about it\\'s not affecting me it\\'s only affecting my grandchildren which is a dumb idea i hope more and more people start to shift toward thinking about the big picture thinking about the long term thinking about making changes that won\\'t necessarily affect me but will affect people who i care about now i got future generations you know the people that people i love now will will care about later even after i\\'m gone right and but for some reason the same people who say all lives matter don\\'t care about the lives of future generations because they don\\'t care about the environment or they don\\'t take it seriously and they don\\'t take situations like this when their black brothers and sisters say hey we\\'re suffering they don\\'t take that seriously either and it\\'s messed up yeah so i i appreciate you bringing up defunding politics as well and holy shit no no politician should ever get rich like you should never go into into politics to make a fuckload of money to make millions and millions of dollars and that the whole revolving door of politics between lobbyists politician lobbyists politicians uh and you know people who chair corporate boards and take you know crazy speaking fees and tons of huge salaries and you politics shouldn\\'t be a lucrative business politics should be a chore for everybody politics should suck because it\\'s a lot of fucking work it shouldn\\'t be what it is yeah yeah okay um so we got statues coming down all over the place um let\\'s let\\'s really quickly go through the mormon side of this right because there there are some i think a couple of interesting stories within all of this um Brigham Young was vandalized at BYU yeah yeah yeah statue of Brigham Young vandalized with a big old red racist tagged uh right across the base of that statue uh made me really damn happy hey hey hey braiden the glassbox podcast and ground gnomes lc do not condone vandalism yeah that is absolutely the official position we do not condone vandalism of any private or public property on this podcast yes i will say it\\'s it\\'s stunning to me that vandals tend to forget that Brigham Young was also a rapist and like something like ten of his wives were teenagers yeah apropos of nothing we are discussing it\\'s it\\'s amazing that that he gets to skate by on a lot of things and there\\'s a ton of statues of him on private and public property all over Utah all the fuck over Utah yeah it\\'s crazy and whole schools universities named after him yeah um this is the place memorial but yeah i mean you know the the base of the statue had multiple sides you could have easily done racist rapist pedo you know yeah all mass murder he\\'s a hiller of Mormon is totally mass murder homicidal maniac yeah yeah yeah that other people do his murderous biddings right so yeah it\\'s that\\'s really fun um and what\\'s interesting too is like given the history of quote-unquote persecution of Mormonism that\\'s that\\'s a huge topic we kind of dabble into it from time to time on the show right but like given how the Mormons were quote-unquote persecuted you think that the leadership of the church or even just the lay members would show a lot more sympathy for marginalized people who are persecuted by bigoted laws and government policies you would think that Mormons would have a lot of sympathy for people who are being murdered by cops because Mormons were murdered by cops by the by militia like you how do you not see the equation how do you not see that marginalized people are abused by the majority you were once a minority who were abused by the majority and then you fucked off to Mexico and became the majority who abused the minority yeah but like that\\'s still deep in your roots when you hear Mormons talk about mountain metals massacred we were massacred in Missouri and he was legal to kill Mormons in Missouri until 1978 why don\\'t you sympathize with black people who are getting killed every fucking day right no no answer to that right yeah well I even use that argument with a cousin when we were debating about this you know good awesome talking about he was he was saying George Floyd was a terrible person a criminal he\\'s being held up as a martyr and you know he did you know he I can\\'t remember what it was but he like you know attacked a woman or something apparently I don\\'t I don\\'t remember so I\\'m you know paraphrasing but right you know he said he did all these terrible things and he\\'s a criminal and yet and yet he died and I\\'m and I was like you know about Joseph Smith and young women right I thought you\\'re gonna say you know Robocop is a fiction right you don\\'t get Judge Jurean executioner and cops but no yeah you\\'re you\\'re absolutely right that too I was like I was like okay Joseph Smith did something wrong he was apprehended he was killed for it held as a martyr right right and yet what is his what is in his past what is in his history he\\'s a horrible person right and you know we compare you know we compare George Floyd to Joseph Smith for a few minutes oh my god a hot take yeah no shit um yeah it is it\\'s insane to me it\\'s it\\'s absolutely insane to me that the people don\\'t see the equation and really what that is is it comes down to skin color and presentism and and like well my guy was a white guy who was a religious leader and shouldn\\'t have been persecuted but that guy he was he was a black criminal he he was a super predator and you know he was he was a horrible person and he\\'s being held up as a martyr by by the black community you don\\'t you don\\'t see the equations and like if we can discuss the differences between George Floyd and Joseph Smith like Joseph Smith committed fucking treason he didn\\'t he didn\\'t just like he was a counterfeit 20 dollar bill he ran a counterfeiting ring like he he was he was such a criminal he was a tyrant he covered up for abuses he covered up for murders he caused murders to happen like he\\'s he was a fucking monster and he\\'s the guy who you venerate and you swear to avenge the death of him to the third and fourth generation and slit your own goddamn throats if you reveal the secrets that he gave to you you fucking crazy if you don\\'t see the parallels yeah so in all of this it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s and also the first amendment sorry the second amendment gun nutters like where the fuck are you guys in all this right like demonstration okay so freedom of speech sure that\\'s printing something in a in a newspaper but freedom of speech is also demonstrations and the government is shutting down demonstrations repeatedly with less than lethal weapons that are in some respects killing people uh where the fuck are you guys with your guns this is what you this is what you\\'re dreaming for this is what you fucking jack off to every night when you\\'re playing video games where are you in all of this yeah that\\'s what you\\'re advocating what you claim is your constitutional given right because your favorite guy happens to be in power right now get the fuck out of here stick to stick to your guns literally stick to your goddamn guns yeah it\\'s the hypocrisy is wild sometimes you know they say i have my guns so that i can i can rise up i can create a militia i can whenever the government oversteps but when the government is overstepping and they agree with it or it doesn\\'t affect them personally then they\\'re quiet they\\'re silent yep i sleep yeah so in all of this uh mormon ink has functionally infinite resources right like you and i tried to spend 124 billion dollars like we couldn\\'t do it like we could make a staircase of money to the moon and still build a temple on that moon right like they have infinite resources uh you know practically speaking so where has the mormon church the church of jesus christ of latte days saints been focusing all of its attention during this social unrest rebranding in the supreme god damn court yep yep so pretty awesome this is where we get to good news man because june 2020 has been at actually a pretty spectacular month for the supreme court if you\\'re progressive um supreme court just said that lgbtq people are included in the quote unquote sex discrimination part of title seven protections so employers can no longer fire people just for being gay or being transgendered or whatever that\\'s really cool now that\\'s at the federal level those protections only existed in 21 states before the supreme court decision now it\\'s the law of the land everywhere it\\'s just like the aburgefell decision in 2015 for gay marriage right like it\\'s supreme court is the law of the land it\\'s the ruling you stick with it so gay people are now officially protected under sex discrimination uh and it\\'s it\\'s lgbtqp i um a plus it\\'s all all sexual diversity sexual and gender diversity so that\\'s super cool but of course religions are exempted from this because they\\'re they\\'re exempted from following a title seven or discrimination in employment um but the thing is like the church of course filed no less than three emicee or emicee amicus the plural of amicus emicee emicee i don\\'t know how to say anyway they followed filed no less than three amicus amicee briefs that were filed by the church and by bw arguing against the supreme court decision of course um even the minor threat the even the appearance of evil of lgbtq people being considered uh as people is just you know people and like valid people um any even appearance of that is vociferously objected to by the church and fun little fact filed by the churches uh one of these amicus briefs was filed by the church\\'s own kurt maconkey by attorney doucheku who i assume is also related to eliza doucheku who flitners don\\'t know she\\'s one of us yeah she\\'s super ex-morman um so uh uh i digress uh all that said uh what this means is the um churches all across the board are gearing up for a supreme court ruling based on the master cake or masterpiece cake shop ruling uh from last year which crafted new legal terminology uh that still needs to be determined and adjudicated and find its way into jurisprudence uh that terminology is quote neutral and respectful consideration of religious beliefs end quote watch out because that\\'s going to become the new buzzword um among religious circles it\\'s it\\'s shifting away from uh religiously at a birdie or religious liberty is going to now begin to incorporate neutral and respectful consideration of religious practices and beliefs um so the church filed a bunch of amicus briefs uh churches all over the nation file amicus briefs opposing this supreme court ruling it still came out on fucking pride month dude i\\'m so happy i\\'m so proud of uh chief john robin chief justice john roberts and surprisingly i\\'m so happy new gorsage this one came out of fucking left field yeah good job it\\'s amazing and it\\'s sad that it\\'ll was only in 21 states before um but it\\'s pretty amazing that now it is a federal mandate yeah and don\\'t worry listeners like uh it don\\'t give john roberts and you\\'ll go of course it\\'s long uh because they will you know do something that\\'s going to cause us to hate him again but for now hey they\\'re super cool it\\'s pride month everybody\\'s happy um also the supreme court determined that churches are non-essential services uh for covid restrictions um vociferously opposed amicus brief filed by the lds church and when this came out bednar gave a an hour long a virtual lecture at by u law school about covid restrictions in the supreme court decision um he considers this a complete affront to religious liberties uh which is interesting too because like covid cases uh states are opening up all over the the nation covid cases are skyrocketing everywhere so if uh if churches start back up i uh i think i should probably tweet at bednar and say so when my dad goes back to church and dies from coronavirus do i sue just you bednar for the the speech you just gave it by u law school or do i sue his bishop or is it his stake president or i just want to know who i\\'m filing murder charges against i am just really curious yeah i just i\\'m spitball in here i just want a clear answer you\\'re a law talking dude help me out help me help you you\\'re just trying just trying to play ahead yeah totally awesome um uh hi and he comes back to the persecution complex fuck yeah it does fuck yeah no no it\\'s not religious persecution it\\'s trying to save people and it\\'s like trying to create a society that\\'s equal that everybody has to follow the same goddamn rules that just because you say that my sky daddy says that i don\\'t have to do that that you don\\'t have to do that that\\'s not fair that\\'s not cool you\\'re not that\\'s not a poor old society fuck you you\\'re not exempt if everyone else is having to physically distance you need to also because guess what you can broadcast your services to people\\'s homes and phones so chill you\\'re not persecuted they\\'re not saying you can\\'t preach dude and he was so goddamn pissed off that liquor stores and cannabis dispensaries are considered essential and church is not which for the record fuck yeah totally agree with the supreme court ruling there uh but he\\'s super fucking mad but it\\'s like what happens at church that people can\\'t get virtually nothing not there there is nothing there\\'s nothing what do what happens at church that sacraments need to survive that they need for their survival nothing nothing that people aren\\'t living off of sacrament they don\\'t need it for sustenance there\\'s nothing that happens at church that people need to survive and when ward members are clean of chapels hmm can we trust them how good how good did they really sanifies that door handle of that toilet seat when that when that deacon goes into the bathroom with this uh squirt bottle and he comes out two minutes later was it clean yeah and then that same deacon is the one who is uh you know setting up the the water trays for sacrament right and picking his nose thinking his nose uh so yeah uh church is super pissed about that missionaries can now wear business casual they can wear blue shirts now oh yeah but only in some scenarios and no neckties sometimes yeah yeah super cool and yeah i i just i think that nothing right now is more important for the church to be thinking about and have at least some statements about i can\\'t think of a single topic or issue that is more important than than mission religious liberties dress oh yeah yeah no yeah yeah yeah um yeah missionaries no no longer wear ties that\\'s that\\'s what the church is worried about and i support them in that yeah priorities priorities priorities priorities i will say though byu did just form a committee to quote unquote examine race and inequality at byu uh link in the show notes uh this panel of eight people consists of three latin x men uh two black women and then three white men so awesome my question is what power are they gonna have can they they can create suggested policy adjustments i assume but like an eight person committee isn\\'t gonna fix racism at byu because they can\\'t fix racism and Mormonism right so that\\'s that\\'s the underlying problem you know it it can it can definitely raise the conversation similar to the protests and reason conversation globally you know they\\'re gonna you know and it kind of started that way with lgbt lgbtq rights at byu and and it opened up discussion and you know things have changed and improved to some degree but for the same reasons the church is homophobic the church is messed up right so when there\\'s underlying homophobia and there\\'s underlying racism ultimately you can only get so far yeah bingo bingo uh so there\\'s gonna be uh you gotta work within the confines there\\'s gonna be a website you know there\\'s more men\\'s and gays there\\'s gonna be a website mormons and poc you know there\\'s gonna be something like that for just for pr reasons but then when you get go to the doctor and it still has racist stuff in the book of warman no shit nothing\\'s actually changed right now yeah revive the genesis group or something i was like the church\\'s segregated group in the 1970s yeah serious great yeah so like how do we fix racism and Mormonism then because obviously this committee of eight people is not gonna do anything substantial right because they don\\'t have any power it\\'s all the profit and apostles um you got to decaninize the prolograte price in the book of mormon you have to you absolutely have to uh just simply removing racially charged verses that ignores the white supremacist premise of the scriptures anything short of decaninizing those books it\\'s never gonna be enough you can distance yourself from them you can walk away from them you can disavow the teachings in those books until they\\'re decaninized they\\'re still your goddamn scriptures they\\'re still your god\\'s words so your god\\'s a goddamn racist so yeah huh good news all around man yeah um well and let\\'s just summarize everything that we talked about today like change is coming change is happening change is happening quickly right now and keeping vigilant is super important during these changing processes because the more change that happens the more steps are on the process that correct powers in uh you know self-interested groups and people can weasel their way into those systems and make change happen less uh state vigilant attend your city council meetings email your city councilors email your senators um try to call them if you can try to get a meeting with them if you can uh and adopt language language is important adopt language and slogans that will foster good conversations and cut through the propaganda and bullshit that the media is selling everybody on all sides of the political spectrum yeah yep all right man i agree uh let\\'s let\\'s uh wrap up a little bit of media we got so long tonight oh my god we\\'re uh almost three hours are that yep marathon session yeah give me an inch i take three hours inch and hours those are different units of measurements ah blast for me not in my world quiet please media of great price so braiden um there\\'s some really good media out there right now that\\'s being promoted and pushed by media companies yes there is good stuff yes why don\\'t you tell us about what you watched yeah totally uh i haven\\'t talked enough this episode yet so i\\'ll start Annie and i watched uh thirteenth it\\'s a documentary on Netflix it talks about it uses the premise of the thirteenth amendment which abolished slavery as a premise to talk about racist structures in america super important and what i think people need to do for a while um you know Netflix and a lot of a lot of streaming companies right now are basically doing like BLM specials where they\\'ve curated a list of movies and documentaries that just introduce you to a lot of very broad and important topics so i\\'m just going to recommend listeners if you have Netflix or you have hulu or if you have you know prime or whatever just take a saturday or take it an entire day and just press play on whatever\\'s there and just let that shit feed you for a few hours uh thirteenth or any of the other tv shows that are on there any of the movies or docs that are on on these streaming services let them feed you you can deal with the information after it\\'s been fed to you you can digest it and fit it into your your narrative and your worldview and fit everything together but just sit there like a sponge and let the docs feed you and deal with the feelings that it gives you a thirteenth is uh very discomforting it caused any and i to both just fucking rage around our apartment for hours after we watched it it sucks but it fostered a lot of really important conversations between the two of us there\\'s some graphic images uh videos people dying people being killed by cops people being lynched um but these are important and in many ways these are the the shock things that get us to have the conversations that have to fucking happen now so yeah thirteenth it was really good they\\'re really good uh they even had uh people on there that i didn\\'t expect like newt gingrich new gingrich even provided an interview and he said the quiet part out loud he said all the racist parts just out loud right into the camera it\\'s fucking amazing and how everything was so very deliberately calculated with tying drugs uh and crack to uh the black communities and in the heavier policing like he he just says it he just says it outright right into the camera it\\'s it\\'s amazing uh man totally worth a watch i haven\\'t watched it it\\'s one that i have known that i need to watch for a long time yeah similarly to other things that i\\'ve avoided um i knew they would be hard to watch and i that\\'s why i haven\\'t watched them and that\\'s one of them on my list um 12 years of slave was another one for a while that i didn\\'t watch that\\'s that\\'s a hard watch yeah um but thirteenth is definitely on my list and i\\'m gonna reiterate what you said even disney plus has a um a collection of movies and and and properties that they are streaming um awesome that are family friendly you know for um black voices uh there\\'s animated stuff there\\'s documentary type stuff there\\'s yeah just made for tv Disney movies there\\'s um so yeah and i\\'ve seen it on every platform HBO as well what i\\'m going to talk about is something for pride month yeah awesome yeah so uh there is an animated short that you can watch with your kids or watch with yourself or watch with your partner or watch with your parents that is uh it\\'s called out just o ut and it\\'s about a man who is struggling to come out to his parents hmm and it\\'s only that\\'s less than 10 minutes long probably five minutes long and it\\'s a just a cute little animated short and we\\'ve actually watched it a few times with our kids and they loved it and our youngest was kind of confused at first like right he\\'s like what\\'s happening and then but then it was cool that here our older kids like explained it to him like well he\\'s gay and a lot of gay people struggle with telling their parents that they like that you know that\\'s awesome who likes other men wow and then and then you know but then the other one the other one chimes in is like well or women who like women or or or people who like both you know that\\'s so good dude oh well good job and yes well i\\'m not i\\'m not saying it for a pat on the back i\\'m just saying it for families out there it\\'s just through resource like you know yeah a great resource to share with your kids and to get a conversation started or even with your parents you know because things that are there\\'s a whole Reddit called explain it like i\\'m five and for older generations who maybe aren\\'t as who are more conservative there\\'s something about movies made for children that can speak to the heart of someone who is older or it\\'s just it simplifies things and it makes things more easy to to digest and understand in a much more broken down way you know doesn\\'t have to be a complex thing right people right love people that\\'s what it comes down to and you know love is love is love and that\\'s all that really matters and it doesn\\'t it doesn\\'t have to be a weird scary topic and anyway it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s interesting the way that they they present it uh in the short i\\'m not gonna spoil anything okay nothing crazy but uh yeah there\\'s uh there\\'s a freaky friday type situation a body switch type situation very interesting short so i\\'m not sure if it\\'s on youtube i know sometimes they put uh shorts on youtube but it is streaming on disney plus um which has which is free for a year if you\\'re a Verizon customer uh if you don\\'t if you\\'re not sure about just paying the $4.99 per month and others ton of streaming services you can\\'t subscribe to o-hall right um but i hope uh you\\'re able to watch that and if you do i hope you watch it with someone you care about so awesome thanks for sure man uh why don\\'t we wrap it up if uh this hasn\\'t been too long of an episode already uh we do have a new iTunes review we absolutely love our iTunes reviews they really go a long way to help with visibility and helping find new listeners so if you enjoy the content we produce like our latest review hey you go leave a sort of you or go share the show and maybe your friend will leave us a review uh because you\\'re you\\'re not kind enough to your dear podcast host to leave us a review anyways this came in from vegan RN uh interesting choice uh the trivia episode was fun is a subtitle it\\'s a five star review and this review says i\\'ve had some time to catch up on podcasts and i\\'ve been loving the glass box thanks for the conference review uh you poor soul trudged through that uh the non believing missionaries interview and trivia night yeah seriously like all of our longest episodes uh those have been my favorite lately keep up the good work so to vegan RN thank you so much for sending in that review seriously that\\'s a lot of pod catching apps use iTunes rankings to recommend podcasts and when you have a Mormon themed podcast that\\'s current events and you title it glass box podcast nobody knows what the fuck it is so uh having these reviews having these recommendations actually goes a really long way to helping us out so thank you so much for that yeah thank you we have a pledge edit on patreon.com a pledge increase that came in from rob rigby this is somebody who i\\'ve actually personally met thanks rob good day last time i saw you was at sunstorm but it\\'s good to good to see your name on here uh so thank you so much for pledging to support the show but rob also send in a couple uh comments from our last episode episode 49 uh first was man i was indoctrinated unconsciously i was promoting white superiority i was trained too well uh which hey we all were because we are all seeing white superiority from primary age right we all were yep he says uh you know i\\'ll share rob\\'s uh story here as well it says i was a convert uh sorry i was a convert at 17 years old and went on a mission at 19 years old and everything religious was new to me i remember the first time an investigator bible basher black dominican asked me why i thought jesus was white which we had a conversation about that last episode uh when the bible says the stories took place in the middle east when jesus was born in the middle east i\\'d never questioned it before but the answer came to me so easily i asked the man who was the father of jesus was it a middle eastern man no i replied jesus was a son of god and thus shares the same physical characteristics of god who is perfect unblemished and white oh wow uh you know there are two hearts on that comment i\\'m gonna give a third heart even though it\\'s like because just because it hurts and i\\'m sure it hurts to write that but rob thanks for sending that in um for you know sharing those comments yeah that\\'s a brave admission kudos to him for sharing that that\\'s yeah wow that hurts that hurts yeah uh but that\\'s that\\'s the story that\\'s the theology so totally yep it is i\\'m sure i made up things like that on the spot on my mission as well yeah right glad i didn\\'t go um we also got a comment in from our resident general authority shannon grover uh shannon uh said uh because last episode i was like click some links we put all the time and put in the links click somewhere we\\'re not friends and shannon said i click some i click some we can stay friends and then uh the second comment is just gold she said case for the book of mormon bradon when brice asked you if you\\'re ready to wrap this review up you said absolutely wrong there it is pronounced abso fucking lutely i couldn\\'t agree more with shannon there uh which means the next episode we\\'re gonna do our first installment of what are we doing bradon uh plingon skelator his his book his book the naked communist hell yes hell yes i love it uh i\\'m so excited for that oh man yeah it\\'s gonna be interesting if you want to know why mormon politics are the way they are this book will tell us why yeah and it\\'s probably going to be pretty prescient reading it because it was published in the mid 50s reading it now is going to be like oh this is 70 years ago but it applies to now shit all right also uh shannon sent me in a personal message an email from the bishop of the ward that she is you know in the geography of their bishop has been like teetering on starting up church again turns out her bishop caught the rona so they are not doing it uh maybe opened up church a little bit hastily there whoopsie that\\'s like and that\\'s in a utah ward too there was a uh i forgot which county but like the county the head county sheriff guy here in Arizona not my county but a neighboring one who was like you know super against anything shutting down and masks and all of that just and i\\'m very outspoken about it and got it then he yep he you just like within the last day or two talk they just announced or i just saw news that he got it and it\\'s just like oh man the karma it\\'s yeah right sweetly it\\'s like when joseph smith was rebuking the cholera during zyan\\'s camp and then he like caught it and almost died from it it\\'s it\\'s so good it\\'s so good it\\'s like virus doesn\\'t care what your fucking god thinks about it it\\'s a virus you don\\'t control it uh i love it i love it it\\'s good stuff all right well thank you all listeners for tuning in uh if you\\'re a patron supporter you get to hear uh extend editions of every episode patreon.com/glassboxpod as well as just you know when we occasionally do extra stuff but hey braiden man thanks for thanks for coming and hanging out in spite of being a recovering zombie yeah i am the walking dead um but i will say that my skull is not as soft as they are portrayed in the movies as well it\\'s uh it\\'s it doesn\\'t you know doesn\\'t just crackle and crunch under a boot as so easy so it\\'s uh oh that\\'s that\\'s good point everyone test it out i know but sorry to break your heart at least he didn\\'t break my shoe all right see you listeners [Music] [Music]', 'rssUrl': 'https://glassboxpodcast.libsyn.com/rss', 'epTitle': 'Ep 49 - Defund Politics', 'epDescription': \"<p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Lots of interlocking stories to discuss this week. We jump right in with a discussion about the most recent headlines sparked by the protests following George Floydâs death. A lot of legislation has been crafted in response to the protests, including an executive order from President Donald Trump. We examine the organizations he listed during the signing to determine the intent of the order, followed by looking at the text of the order itself. Once created, tools can be used for good and evil. Then we discuss CHOP, the occupation movement in Capitol Hill, Washington. The Seattle City Council crafted resolutions in response to the leverage held by the CHOP protestors joined by protests across the nation. Seattle chose to ban the use of chokeholds, riot control weapons, and officers covering their badge numbers. We weigh in on #DefundPolice and how useful it can be in sparking a conversation, but why does the âdefundingâ stop at police? Then we finally tackle the Mormon angle by examining the recent rulings in the Supreme Court concerning churches being ânon-essentialâ services and LGBTQ+ people actually being people with Title VII protections. We wrap the episode with some great media for understanding racism in America as well as coming out as gay to your family.</span></p> <p>\\xa0</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Links:</span></p> <p>\\xa0</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Trumpâs Executive Order on Police Reform</span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'><br /></span><a href= 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities</span></a></p> <p>\\xa0</p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Orgs mentioned during EO signing</span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'><br /></span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>Federal law enforcement officers association</span> <a href= 'https://www.fleoa.org/news.aspx?id=19'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.fleoa.org/news.aspx?id=19</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Fraternal order of police</span> <a href='https://www.fop.net/CmsPage.aspx?id=39'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.fop.net/CmsPage.aspx?id=39</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Internal ass of chiefs of police</span> <a href='https://www.theiacp.org/'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.theiacp.org/</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Intl union of police association;

      "{'transcript': \" [Music] [Music] The idea for all this really came from a dream. Yes, you did. Good evening and welcome to Noxmente. Tonight's guest is Michael Deacon. Michael has had a number of unusual unexplained events that have occurred in his life. A natural skeptic, he often finds himself at odds with his own experiences. Now the cryptic symbolism in his strange experiences has begun to slowly decode itself before his eyes. He's also the creator and host of the Michael Deacon program. Michael, welcome to the show. Hello, how are you? I'm doing well. Is there Michael? Howdy. [Laughs] So this is hilarious. So I think we've already got maybe some haters. That's okay. [Laughs] How many? How many is some? I don't know. Anyone that knows Michael Deacon knows that Michael doesn't care. And so that's great. It's a great honor to have you on Noxmente, Michael. You know, I know you don't do these shows very often, so I'm thrilled that you have decided to say yes to it and are here. Yes, hello to both of you out there. And of course, to those listening at home. And of course, thank you for giving me this opportunity to hang out with both of you this evening. Thanks for driving us. Yes, yes. And of course, I must be honest, I don't do interviews at all. I try to be somewhat mysterious and exclusive, but the planets have aligned. Yes, yes, and it's Mercury retrograde nonetheless. I'm glad I'm here and I'm glad both of you are here. And of course, everyone that is happy and angry that I'm here. Well, I don't know who I'm just sure. I'm just sure, you know, because I moderate on your channel and you get a couple haters here and there. And you know, I... Beam, emails, you know. I immediately get a thumbs down like basically everything I do. There's somebody out there. Yeah, we got one already too. So, talking about people. Michael, that's my thumbs down. So don't take my glory. I even thumbs down this show tonight. Actually, I'm going to spend most of the time I give the show a thumb down too. Forties. Hey, it's interaction, right? Of course. Indeed. So let's get on with this. All right, so here we are. So thrilled you're here. And I want to know the world wants to know, Michael, about young Michael. And so bring us young, very young. You're very first like memories in life. What sticks out like pop culture, you know, did you enjoy nature, that kind of really early stuff? Well, we're going deep already. I'm getting at you, baby. I'm getting at you. All righty. You're not even... No foreplay. I'll write you a third base here. One of the first names we thought of for the show was called Ball's Deep. So yeah, we're going deep. You don't have so much. Hard and fast. You're in that seat. You're in the other seat, Mr. Michael. No, it's because I was so curious about you and Jerry. Tom and Jerry or me and Jerry? You and Jerry, right. Well, Jerry lives in the Atlanta area and I live in the Washington area, as you know. Right. But I was always curious, why on earth would you do a show like this? See, look at you. You can't put around. You can't put down your interview side. I know. I know. Isn't it hilarious? We can reserve that discussion for like... Yeah, doing the second half of the show. How's that? Yeah. You can have this on your show. I've been on your show, though. Yes. So what exactly... just your earliest memories. So like, you know, things that pop up that you may have enjoyed in pop culture, like cartoons or movies, weird paranormal stuff. Did you have a relationship with nature? Just that kind of stuff. Well, I can't say I have or had a relationship with nature. But, yes, some early memories I do have go way back. And when I say way back, I mean, even going back to like kindergarten and remembering some just weird memories of sitting in a room with a bunch of other kids and sort of not even liking it then. And I still don't like being around kids today. No kids for you, Mr. Deacon. No, I like kids. I just don't like other people's kids. It'd be different. I feel the same, but that's the wolf in me. Were there things like, did you enjoy cartoons or movies or books? Of course, of course. Cat in the hat. Oh, there's a lot of that. It doesn't love that. Right, Jerry. Dr. Seuss holds a special place in my heart. See what I mean? Especially the googoo's. I think it's everyone though. You know, there's like a required set of books that every child must read. Yes. Well, I wonder at this point when cat in the hats on the on the table to be taken off for whatever reason. You know, it's coming. Can I tell her? Really? Is that your prediction? The Grinch is too green. I'll tell you one though, Jerry. Yes. I'm predicting the Bible to be next. Oh, well, they've tried so many times. I think it's going to happen. Really? It's pretty racist against the Jews. It's racist against the Jews. It is. It's not a racist against the Jews. It's not a racist against the Jews. It's not a racist against the Jews. Wow. Well, because they have the first claim on it. By the way, I just want to make something very clear. I'm not a right wing wacko or a convicted felon. Aren't you just. Neither are we. So, yeah. I just wanted to put it out there, you know, for the record. Yeah. Are you getting accused of either of those lately? No, but I'm thinking there's been plenty of people in the past that I.

I love the swamp cooler though. It could be the aliens too. It could be the aliens too. It could be the aliens too. Yeah. Well, that's hard for the course here. I definitely want to get into some of that. Those pesky grays. Well, what about the reptiles? I mean, is reptile on them there? Yeah, they're fake news. Well, the snakes and the lizards are certainly not fake news. But if we're anthropomorphizing them, perhaps. However, so the early dreaming Michael and the early. Michael's. Imagination and all of that. What kind of things were swimming round. That would have caused you. Any fear. And so I'm talking to the child. You know, the young before you became rational. Right. The grandmother passing. Oh. Mm-hmm. What made that so scary? Well, that's kind of when I started to really. Question life itself. And I also was thinking. I'm going to miss my parents when they die. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's all I could think about. Yeah. Yeah. That also said. And that led up to a strange experience I had. It must have been maybe six or seven years old. And my grandmother had passed and. Must have been maybe a month or so after she had passed. And like many other grandmothers or mothers or fathers out there. Depending where you are. I'm sure plenty of us can remember a time or two when. Someone we loved. Would be in the kitchen. Late hours. I'm sure some of your listeners can relate to that. Mm-hmm. Well, my grandmother was the same way. So she would always do this pretty late at night. And after she had passed. There was a time when I woke up and I knew I wasn't dreaming. And I heard noises coming from the kitchen and I heard. Pots and pans moving around and I went over there thinking I'll go say hi to grandma. Oh, wow. And of course I go and it's empty. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. How did you process that process that is a little okay. Very scared. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Were you aware at that time? So your six years old were you aware of the idea of ghosts and all that. Not really. I mean, I hadn't seen something of that nature on. You know, on movies and cartoons, but it really didn't process that. It's not a lot of the sort of story. It's not a lot of the story. It's a lot of the story. It's a lot of the story. That's a lot of the story. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is.

What was the question? What your parents said. What I think everyone. You must have a great grandmother or something that died when you were early when you were young. And so we're talking about what your parents explained death to your young self. They didn't. We don't per talked about it. Yeah. And I only had two grandparents that I know that I knew who died. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. It's a good question. Now I feel like asking my parents. Yeah. It's interesting. Are you an only child or do you have siblings? I am an only child, but my father did have another child. So I have like a half sister. Yeah. That makes you not an only child. I'm a little bit older than you. I'm a little bit older than you.

I'm a little bit older than you. I'm a little bit older than you. I'm a little bit older than you. It was the most blinding light you can imagine. Just engulf the entire room. Even as I closed my eyes in this hotel room, I could still see the very intense bright light. Very, very bright white light. I was told this sort of thing manifested right behind me. Of course, I looked at the news to see if a meteor or any sort of strange anomaly must have happened. Anything like that. But no, it was all just a normal day or night out there. It was a strange experience. It would make it even weirder is the things I was saying leading up to the experience. And that's a whole another long story, just in itself. But I had said, we have the time to talk about it. I'm interested in this one. I was just going to say, it's a make a long story short. I had been doing the show and I was saying, if I don't experience something out there, then I'm just done talking about extraterrestrials. I said, and the afterlife. And then this happened. And the rest is history. What did you and your companion make of it when you were piecing it? So when you have these shared experiences, for me at least, it's I'm always one that I want to dive into the details. Like, how did we end up having this experience? Oh, no. And we don't know. And I just said, the first thing that came out of my mouth was, did you see that? That was the first thing I said. And they said, yes. And I said, that was it. The silence between us both. It was the weirdest thing ever. It wasn't until much later when I kept bringing it up and saying, what, what the hell was that? That that actually happened. And yes, oh, it happened. All right. Again, I would totally dismiss it if, if I wasn't with someone else. I would have said, stories bullshit. Yeah. Well, of course, I mean, I mean, I know, I know this about you, especially when you call yourself an atheist. So. Yeah. So again, I don't know what it was. I have no clue. I don't say it was God. I don't say it was. The Easter Bunny. I don't say it was Muhammad. I don't say it was George Floyd. I don't say any of those things. And Larry, what was the mood? Pretty good. And of course I was, I wasn't high on drugs or anything like that either. What was the, was there like an electrical charge in the air? What was the quality of like, you know, how that it was? I didn't feel that at all. It just felt like any other experience you would have in a hotel room out of town. Totally normal. Everything was cool. Nothing felt. Out of place. Everything felt as it should be. Then this happened. And I'm still confused with what that was. I've talked to a lot of people from David Sreeda to Dr. Michael Schurmer to. Michael Aquino, you know, a lot of these conversations I've had with these individuals. I've had in private. You know, I wish I had those recorded, but I've gone over all these things with these folks and they've told me a long list of a series of what that could have been. And some of those things I wish I could share with you guys now, but I don't know if I could reveal some of my private conversations with these people. I don't want them to get too angry with me. You know, I do have some moral about some morals about me. I do want to keep. Well, privacy is a good moral to have. Yeah, so you mentioned you had a couple of these strange experiences. What was the other? The other was actually with my father. I was at. At my parents house when this happened. And they have another great story too, by the way, maybe I should go back and tell you that story. Yes, bring us, bring us into it. This happened to both of my parents and as you know, the mother. Religious, the father. Not so much much more open minded. He believes in extraterrestrials wholeheartedly. He's he's deep. You know, he goes in there. He loves UFOs. And the mom for a short time, she wasn't really. Too deep with religious, with her religion. By the way, she wasn't that deep into it at the time. She sort of was like taking a sort of a sabbatical, as they say. And what religion is she. He was a Jehovah witness, by the way. Yeah. Don't they have like an alien myth mythos? I don't really know a lot about them. The good thing is I was not. Doctor into any of that. So I can't even tell you. They let me alone with all that. Thank God. Yeah. No special underwear for you. No, well, that's the Mormons. Okay. See, I get them all confused. They're all cults. Yeah. Okay. So not to sidetrack. So this story that you're leading us in with. Definitely, definitely. So for a few years there, the mom was in very religious. And then something odd happened to them both. And I'm super jealous. My dad had sent me a text message telling me to drive over. He said quick. Something over the house. I remember he put that. So I ended up driving over there. And of course I was too late. My father described some sort of. Triangular craft that sort of moved like. Some sort of squid in the ocean. That's how he described it to me. It was. Some sort of. Translucent. Sort of. I have a figure of sorts. I had a figure of two. It blew him away. He had never seen anything like this. And it was up above the house. And once my mom saw it, it freaked her out so bad she went back to religion there for a while. So she probably thought it was demons. Or something like that. Probably who the hell was it? Yeah. I don't know what she might have thought it was, but it blew her way. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure.

She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure. She was like, I'm not sure what, what that is. Why that happens. Why we have these sort of. These characters that sort of come back. Is there a meaning behind that? I don't know. What about flying? Do you fly? Sometimes. Yeah. How do you fly? That is a good question. Sometimes I don't do or try. Sometimes these things just happen. Sometimes these experiences are. Like in like third person. Like I'm not even there. I'm not in control. It's it's it's just I'm writing shotgun. Yes. Yeah. It's always like a. Oh my God. The wolves are back. Yes. The killer wolves. Yes. My black wolves. But yeah, these sort of. So are you like a Superman flyer? Are you in a bubble? Are you on a magic carpet? No, I'm I'm afraid of heights. So, you know, my flying is very slow and methodic. Like the month man. Low and low barbecue. I'm not sure about the month man. I know reference in there because it sounded cool. Yeah. Well, you're going to get all the algorithm loves that, by the way. So we can pull in the month man. The month man, though. So with the. So you're afraid of heights. This is interesting. I also share that. I'm not scared. I am just terrified of heights. I remember when I was probably. 12 years old and I went to Las Vegas with my parents. I think we might have been staying in the. MGM. This is this is way back. And we were way up there and I remember looking down. And the window. I looked down and. I kid you not. I stayed away from windows. For a long time after that. I have the same experience with it. Do you get the is it the butterfly experience in your belly? Oh, big time. Yeah. That goes right. That goes right in there. Do you get like a tingling at the back of your spine? Like right at the topic crack your ass. Like the little bit. It's like it's like the first time you sort of. You know, around the bases with the woman that you. Really are into and she's, you know, playing with you a little bit there. Getting the senses going. It's kind of like that experience. Except. But terrifying. But terrifying. Yeah. Terrifying. Right. Exactly. It's like the just the thought of going on to one of those glass rooms that hang off the Sears tower in Chicago or something like that. I'm like, Oh, my God, I would die. I get that feeling just from thinking about that. I love that we all share this because I'm not having it either. You too. Yeah, I'm not having it. Sky diving and all that shit. No way. I'm good. I am good. I'm not trying to risk it that much. You know. Well, okay. So why do you think this is? I have theories, but I'm just wondering what are your thoughts on why would you have this and it seems like an inherent fear. Yeah. Well, you know, I've had looked into that before and some would say it's probably because that's how I died in a previous life. I don't know if that's true. I don't know how valid those claims are. I don't know. I can't prove or disprove that, but that's what they say. How do you feel about that? Do you think it holds weight or is there something else that may be possible? That's a tough one to answer because I'm still uncertain of that one. And yet the experience is visceral. Sure. I mean, that's the thing for me when I try to deconstruct it. It's very visceral, even in films when you get that look down. My father, actually, he's brought up a strange memory as well. And he brought this up maybe, maybe even a week ago. He tells me that he remembers a lot of things from when he was really young when he was maybe like an impossible way to even be remembering some of the things that he was doing. Remembering some of the discussion he had with his mom. And there was another story he told me where he was remembering past memories, he says, from like the Colosseum. He thinks in his mind, I don't know how, but he has. In Rome? Yeah, I was going to say he has some sort of like odd memory of it. And he's gone into details. And it's the weirdest thing. You're going to have to talk to him one of these days. I find that interesting. And you know, you do have kind of a Roman look to you, by the way. So, good Lord. Mm hmm. Although, you know, you also have a Spaniard look, but you do have a Roman look. So maybe there is some something going on with your papa and Rome. There might be. That's why I would be very interested to really trace my DNA because I'm like a hybrid of sorts. I definitely don't look like most people out here. That's for sure. Oh yeah. You know how I feel. I think we're all hybrids of some sort, unless you're in some really remote place that's, you know, that didn't ever see outside influences. I'm a carny, I like to say. Oh, you get me excited there, Michael. To look like a little burn on. That's right. Amazing. Goddamn amazing. Okay, so, so back on, back on this idea of others, though. And so, I don't like to qualify others. I like to, I like people to bring in the idea of. Or get, I like to get to the idea of what that concept is for people. And so it can be inclusive of you have like ETS, ghosts, entities, you know, it can be all encompassing. It's very rainbow, isn't it? So, aside from dreaming, where do you land with the idea of things that are other than us that are different than us in the fact that non human, I guess is where I'm going, that are non human. Are you asking me what I make of it? Yeah, I mean, what do you, what do you make of it? Yeah, of that, those kinds of things. And we've already mentioned grace. And we know your papa is balls deep into all that balls deep right. So, where do you stand and like I said, I don't qualify this so this really can represent the full gamut of ideas of other than what we are a parent humans right apparent chromagnam, you know. Like I said, this could be entities, it could be evil spirits, it could be EBEs, you know, AI. What are what's your idea on others, especially as an atheist. Maybe I think it depends more on where you were, how you were raised and where you were born in terms of geological locations. I think again, if I was somewhere like in the Middle East, I would think I was experiencing like like the gin is like talking to me, which is on because I had it. I've had one of those experiences before too. But that was, yeah, that's provocative. Tell us about it. Well, I explained this sort of experience to a friend of mine without even knowing what the gin was. But this sort of thing actually woke me up one day or one night by strangling me. I woke up a coughing and hacking up next to the bed there really scared the old lady next to me there. Did you get a visual of it? What was going on with it? It was evil looking. What made it everything. Oh, oh so kind of almost classical glowing red eyes like a fucking genie. Yeah, and there goes the dogs. I think Lucian was agreeing with you. But what made you settle on Jen that that was possibly a gen? Well, it didn't come for me. It came from a friend of mine who sort of made that. That he had that notion rather in his head that that's what it was. That's what that figure was. This was a time when I didn't know what that was at all. I didn't know it had to do with some sort of Middle Eastern sort of entity or spirit. Whatever you want to classify that as that demonic sort of thing, I guess. And so the person that was next to you. Did you did they have any experience with it or it was just you freaking out. I'm a baby. Yeah. No feedback. No, they didn't give a shit. Have you on that note? Have you ever been known to be a sleepwalker or sleep talker? I can systematically say no. No sleepwalk. No that no sleep talking. No, I'm not an ambient. No. None of those things that I know of. I love the stories with ambient where people have like a whole different sex life going. That's actually has happened when I'll be honest with you back when I was like in high school. I think I must have been a senior. I was dating this girl and her parents were one of them was a pharmacist. I don't know if it was the mom or the dad, but. I mean, they had a, you know, that a collection of all sorts of pills. And they and they did have ambient. And this girl was dating gave me a few when I took one. And I was also drinking that night and let's just say it ended with me in tears in my bed. That sounds like a terrible trip. It sounds like an ambient trip, right? I've never done ambient and when I heard people were living like other lives on it. I have control issues. So that is just out of my realm altogether. You don't undo it. Trust me. No, and I definitely don't like the idea of hooking up with people and not know it. First of all, it's bad enough knowing. You know, at least you're consenting that you could be getting some funk or something, but then not knowing. And it has to do with a sleeping aid. A hell no. That's like, so not having it. Isn't that the sleep eating drug? Yeah, it's the, it's notorious. I believe Rosie O'Donnell was a victim of the same experience. She had a whole different stuff. Sex life going. Not the sex. Sleepy. She was, yes, she was sleeping and tweeting and tweeting and all kinds of crazy. She bling that. And I thought, you know what? That's actually a good excuse. Right. You can, you can hedge that. Yeah, I was going to say I could hedgeable. Exactly. I would think that's very tangible. That's a good excuse, a good reason, a good purpose. I can't say I haven't done something egregious like that under the influence of some sort of a barbiturate of sorts. I'm not sure. Like an ambient or a Selma. A Selma. There's always a story when you take those two drugs or Xanax for sure. If you take more than you know, you should, you're always going to wake up and have a story. Of course, you're not going to remember it until maybe 48 hours later than you'll, but you'll still have a story. I'll tell you, I'll tell you, take two Zannie bars and you're out cold. There's no way I'm going to go driving around or anything. Memories. Yeah. Memory. Good. You know, there was, I did like, I did. I still will if they're floating around. I'll have me a mama's little helper that the volume is that I hear Xanax is kind of like the modern version of that. Yeah. So, let's just say a friend of mine, he was driving a 72 of Buick and we were. Oh, that's classic. Messing with those. We call them Xanax. Yeah. The football bars as we call them. What does 72 be? You know, it's never good news when a friend shows up in one of those with a handful of pills and. I'll sort of other things. Oh, Lord. Was it on hydraulics? No, it was just some old. Can I just thought down? This is not going to end well. I never did. Oh, Lord. Get rid of that friend. If you have one, you don't want to be from them. God, you don't have babies around. Do you? No babies. No. No crumbs, as they say. I've gotten very smart in life. This is turning into Michael Deacon show. I know. I know. I know. It's hilarious. Okay. So back to back to this idea of others. So, yeah, the others. What do you so intellectually where you are now and with your papa where he is in his scope of experience, at least knowledge and know how and then the experience you've had with him. And a couple of the strange things that he has also logged. What are your ideas of. Do you. So I know I asked this question. And it generally, but now I'm coming into the E. T. thing for sure and specific. What do you think all that is? Is it outer space? You know, what are your ideas on space in general? Let's start there. Yes. Well, space is forever. It's endless possibilities of what can and cannot happen. Is it different than the ether field? I don't think it's any different. I think it's all. One of the same. I think all of this is just all one, as you know, and in 2020. All bets are off. Anything is possible. That's my mindset right now. And of course the skeptic in me. The one who looks at it from the inside and outside. I always think, well. How do you explain the out of body experience? Are these hallucinations self delusions? Is that what that is? Is this a psychotic episode, perhaps? Are these memories that we've surpassed somehow? And now they are upfront because we're stressed out in our lives. Are these things that we sort of just made up? This is a form of psychosis. That's the skeptic in me. That's the sort of thing I think about when I'm when I self reflect into all the things I've mentioned here and all the experiences I've had. I always wonder that myself or the psychotic episodes that I experienced. Was it all bullshit that that actually happened? I don't know. And that's the skeptic in me. That's the spiritual battle inside of me that hasn't stopped. How do you how do you come upon the idea that this is a real experience that it's as tangible as anything else? Like what what makes this apparent reality real for you? Well, the fact that things hurt life hurts. So that lets me know that this is real. If that makes any sense. But haven't you had pain in a dream? Never. Really? I have not felt pain in a dream. I felt not even emotional pain in a dream. Never. I felt good. But fear. Not even fear. Okay. You're like a you're like a super I love it. Something I'm like addicted to that. Yeah. Okay. That's another thing. Another reason why I like taking breaks from enjoying cannabis because the dreams are so intense. And for some it freaks people out, but I accepted them. All the horrible things that happen to people with these strange dreams they in the happening and they don't want to go back to sleep again. They have trouble sleeping because of a sad dream. Not me though. The worse the better. Do you so when so on can do you have dreams when you're on cannabis? Very rarely. I prefer. I prefer what it's like when I'm not on on anything. It's a straight sober. Yeah. Crazy as hell. Yeah, they get really vivid then. Extremely vivid like if it's actually happening. But no pain. If I think it's going to really hurt me, I just wake up. And I know I'm dreaming though. That's another great thing. I'm always cognitive if that makes sense that I'm always aware. Well, that's a higher state of lucidity. So in all your dreams, you're, you're aware that you're dreaming. I'm aware and I'm, I don't know if I'm completely in control because again, I'm like in that third. Controlness and awareness are different. Right. There's a difference there. And some people, some people do like to get in and ride the control thing and be the architect. You know, they like to do what though. I mean, I could, I could sort of manifest a few things in the dream that I want to happen. I could do that. I don't, I can't explain how I could do that, but I've done that time and time again in the sort of a dream world. But as far as like really just controlling everything, it's, I can't do that exactly. It's sort of like I'm limited in what I could do. If that makes any sense at all. Oh yeah. And it's, it's actually common. So it plus, you know, lots of people that get in and have extreme lucidity high levels of lucidity that are in fact, you know, able to be the dream, like architects within the dreamscape that prefer to, of course, this is what they tell me that prefer to allow. So the dream narrative to play is going to, they find it more exciting to see what's going to unroll and and go with that. So it's, it's interesting. I'm always interested by it. What about, have you had any ideas on that? So, and this doesn't have to be segregated to the idea of dreaming and your dream life. This is one for just a general sweep of your full point, zero point of consciousness. So, you know, I'm not sure what your ideas on other states of consciousness that let's, you know, let's start with death. What do you think goes on. And, and this is where there is a line in the sand between an atheist and an agnostic. Ah yes, death. Very scary stuff right. Forever right. I don't know I'm asking you. Everyone knows my opinion. Oh, I don't know your opinion though. We'll save that for later Michael. No worries, no worries, but yes, death. It's a very odd sort of thing. And that goes back to some of the memories I had when I was really, really young thinking I don't want my parents to die. I don't want to die. And, you know, I still feel that way. But death is very final. Yes, going back to, going back to the silent tomb as they say, going back for the long nap. So do you think that there's nothing that that's it game over? Part of me feels that way. You know, part of me feels we don't have any tangible evidence that would demonstrate that there is an afterlife. How do you demonstrate that? Of course, that's the question. But you had this early experience with your grandma, Ma. Right. But see, that's where that the skeptic and me comes out naturally. I still question myself and I question death itself as well. I think, well, it seems pretty final. I don't have any evidence that would prove otherwise. But then there is that part of me that wants there to be an afterlife. I want you to be some sort of experience. And when I talk to other people about the afterlife, I always ask, so what do ghosts do? What are they doing in the afterlife? What do these ghosts? What are they up to? What are their activities in the afterworld or afterlife? What could they be doing this whole time? And then, of course, I think about rebirth. Mm hmm. That always goes through my mind as well. Well, do you think it is it possible that we could be in the afterlife right now? This could be your afterlife. It could be. And you're subscribing to a set of rules. Right. And clearly, the outer world around us, whatever that is, is breaking down. And things that people thought would not ever happen are happening. And so a lot of impossible stuff is on the plate now. And so I think that's a really important thing. From, you know, scientific advances that are being publicly acknowledged now to to geopolitical, just the struck the fabric of our reality is completely breaking down. And I think that's a really important thing. And I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. I think that's a really important thing. This is existentialism, you know, but there's no reason why this, for me, this can't actually be causal loops, causality loops reverberations of lives and consciousnesses and, and all the stuff, all this muckedy muck. And we're in, in this afterlife state. I mean, clearly, we have pain and clearly there are high stakes. However, how high are the stakes? You know, we're looking at all this stuff play out before us. We all sort of have this sort of like a paradoxical sort of existence. It's kind of funny, right? It is. I mean, that's one of the grand things here. There's a lot of self contradiction. Yes. Definitely. And some of the things that I think about and subscribe to you. Sure. Well, that's where the good stuff is. I always think about that as well. I think a lot of the stuff I talk about. There's some self contradictory there at times. What's like smashing particles. That's the spiritual battle with it from within. I would say. Absolutely. But if you don't smash these particles together, these ideas as particles together that are contradictory. How do you break ground? How do you know inside of a dull rock that there might be some glorious crystals like a geode? Sure. You know, there's just so many ways to approach this. That it seems limiting. We limit ourselves. This is the eight of cups in the tarot or that I'm not the eight of cups, the eight of swords in the tarot. We limit ourselves. And by limiting our selves, are we doing ourselves a favor? Do you think with this just pure materialism that this is the game and it's the only game? This experience of life. All you have in this world is yourself. You don't have anyone else there for you at the end of the day. It's just you. Your thoughts. Oh, my mama told me that's a Tracy Chat and song. A good song. But yes. Life is all about loving yourself first. People forget about that though. And that's when they fall into depression and that's when their hatred comes about them. And it's exactly another example of what we are seeing today. And in front of us right before our very own eyes, especially in TV, you can see what's going on. Lots of angry individuals out there and all goes back to simple things going back to the households going back to controlling one's anger and the character that is that that is from within that individual out there who's angry that hates the world that hates themselves. I'd always goes back to the moral character. That's what I see in life. Really. I don't see any sort of a racism or anything. It always goes back to the character of that individual. So with all this, this kind of territory we're walking on, what are your ideas of the vastness of experience so you know the way that some people speak of reincarnation or the, you know, the, the, the, so this is taking you, this is taking you out of atheist territory. But I gather from our chat here and then others have had with you and all this that I mean you're definitely open. It's not like you're closed off. There's, there's this. Why does atheism have anything to do with afterlife. Atheists believe there is nothing after it's hard. Exactly mean that different atheists out there have different sort of understandings and sort of. I guess, definition of what they truly believe and I'm under the notion of I just simply don't have any tangible evidence that would prove to me personally that there is, or isn't a God. That's what I mean when I say I'm an atheist. That's a classical definition of it and I agree I'm the same way I think it's all have evidence. The absence of evidence just like I say faith is not a tangible pathway to truth. The way I understand it and trust me as a, I've been a card carrying and see this is a member and all that is just not a reliable pathway to truth. That's just, it's always been that way for me. I always come back to that. I don't know why, but that is always something I always roll back to. You know, there's the idea of like, I was married once upon a time and his father, it was a hot fiery beautiful married. I was it was hot and delicious and he was very Johnny Cash. Anyway, so, but his father was totally an atheist and he, you know, he was like burn me and throw my ashes in the trash can. And I've gotten to a very intelligent man. And, and in many ways, his son Scott home I married, who was raised a Catholic by the way, was very atheistic as well. And, you know, we, we had lots of these discussions because that's just, this is the kind of stuff that interests me. Sure. And, and so one of the baseline understandings about atheism as opposed to agnostic belief is it's lights out like you already described on death, like a pond death it's lights out that's it game over shows done. Nothing's going on and the God factor didn't come in to it. And whereas opposed to agnostic was yes, they're open to the possibility that there's, there's gods and all that other stuff, but they're also not closed off on the idea of it's not necessarily lights out when you die. So this is a big factor in at least old school atheism. And when you're reading like old school psychological books, that's a little bit down in there in the fundamental side of it. So, I know that it's gotten like all language now is very fuzzy. And the boundaries are, are ever vibrating and changing and it's hard for people to understand each other. This is one of the, by the way, you're a biased right. Oh, I don't throw names at myself at all. And do I, and is no, I wouldn't call myself a theist. No. What about you, Jerry? I'm of the opinion that all religion is mind control. And the idea of the idea of a creator or source or God is complete nonsense. I think that's kind of the notion I subscribe to. But, however, this is a social construct, religion. However, I do recognize the quote unquote gods as archetypes that have had energetic intention thrown their way and can offer benefit in the work in magical works and whatnot. They're created through the human consciousness to our typical archetypical entities, if you will, that exist wherever. But they're not a psychology model. Yeah. I don't know what it is. Just what I think. It's a depth psychology framework for sure. And, and which is lovely. I mean, I got caught in that trap for years. And, and I still have it's one of my main overways, especially one more on the Union slant. But it's all open for me. And so, yeah, that's the thing. I always say, why do we believe the things that we do? Do we believe them because they make us feel better or because of their, their facts? Well, which one is it? Those are both traps. And if we'd never been taught these things, would we even come to those notions? Would we believe them anyway? Exactly. But that's like, that's part of that construct, you know, or the conditioning. It's just odd that the human mind is conditioned to worship whatever doesn't understand. Well, it's the people they, they all have stories of worshiping those in the stars, those in the heavens. Well, as you say, Michael, the world is a mysterious place and they were viewing it that way. The world is a mysterious place, no doubt, but it's also, it's also a stage just like Shakespeare said, the world's age. The theater of the absurd, the magic theater of the mind is hashed said. So, I mean, all this stuff's juicy, but at the end of the day, I come more from an agnostic standpoint where I know something is going on bigger than this, and that this experience of consciousness of zero point consciousness and what I mean by zero point is, I'm in here right now in this shell that, you know, we all know as nation and we're having this conversation. But outside of that, I, and so outside of the ego identity and outside of the quaternity of my personality, I acknowledge, I have some acknowledgement on on some larger scale with myself. I'm not sure what it is that there's way more going on that that I looked through the idea of everything we're experiencing is very, we've got blinders on we know this that just from light spectrum and all that there's so much that is possible in my world that I know there's more going on and that's where the agnostic and me shines there's more going on I don't know what it is. I don't have conviction and anything and I'm certainly not pushing it anyone. So that's how I landed on agnostic ag, agnostic being in the agnostic soup. Once you start getting into the ism so you got trouble. So such thing as isms as well. They're like, the isms are their own eat. Yes, so I always say what's going on here why don't facts change our minds. But what is this idea of facts what are facts. I always just think why would someone continue to believe a false or an accurate idea anyways. Why believe in things you can prove. Because they fear death. This is what isn't that the most provocative thing where we stand now, because that's the this is the veiled Isis death is the the great build. You know goddess death is outer space or inner space death is that which we can't access until we do access and there's no road back. And so, and I love I love the veiled Isis mythos it just seems to me. So, but we're all headed there and that's what I'm constantly saying there's as many different people on the planet. Everyone's road coalesces, you know, we bottle neck into that's that's a single point, just like birth was when you came in. No matter how real this is it's like the VR experiences that are happening now where they tap into your nervous system, where you can be in a virtual environment. And, and if you've got if you're tapped into your nervous system, you're going to feel pain, you're going to feel pleasure, you're going to feel loss and sadness and great joy. And I postulate upon that idea of this now tech that's available to the masses. How is that a differentiation point between this Michael. Oh, that's loaded. That's a whole lot there to consume there. And I'm just throwing you big bones. You really are. I mean, how do I even explain any of this. Well, I'm asking your ideas so you don't know you don't have to back any of this up. It's just ideas. It's just like where are you with chewing this kind of fodder and that's all the show is about. This is the night mind. It's just I don't even know where to begin. I'm really honest with you. Well, so I guess that segues us into the idea of sim reality. As I was saying, you can get right now you can get hooked up with a neural receiver VR experiences. And which is funny because 20 years ago when my mother was still alive. And there was a guy named David who worked for Lockheed Martin, who she was helping I marry. And he had taken me into Atlanta. And he had taken me into Lockheed Martin and was showing me tech that they had then he was quite high up. And there was full on craze the VR experiences. So I remember who put me in this one set up and get up. I couldn't even function. It blew my mind. Seriously. He hooked up these, this like net to my head. And then I got this whole set of like goggles. And then my hands went into this stuff and then my feet. You know, and he he's basically said I have you, which I think was a means for him to fill me up. That's pretty long. Hello, he did. I didn't need him because I was I was following about I couldn't get he had suited up to. So he's in there with me. And it was overwhelming. I could smell the breeze. I could see we were he made it cartoonish though so we were he was like a we were cartoonish in a way. But I could smell I was having a sense of smell. And he pushed me inside he pushed me over. And I felt like in my body outside wanted to do that too. And so that's where he had me. And stuff like that the experience was no different. And the reason why this is over 20 years ago. And the reason why this was provocative to me was because when I came out of it. I couldn't differentiate between that experience and this experience. Things heard in there I smelled. I'm sure I would taste he said you can taste. And and they were using that tech to train people for whatever Lockheed Martin was doing. I have no idea. I wish I had paid more attention. And I actually now wish I would have dated him. I just want to hear what's this by the way. It was like. Oh, God. Late 90s late 90s. Yeah. Yeah. And so, but my point here is because now that stuff's not a secret. And one of the things why he said he ran this the cartoonish and those weren't his words was so that I was like he did that specifically because I guess they had other, you know, they had other landscapes and stuff for people training for whatever whatever purposes. I was not paying attention. I was young and not paying attention to him in those the sense I wish I'd have been more on board with that. Well, that's life. Well, but the thing, the thing though, Michael is it was no different than this. And that's my point here. Right. And so that's my point with you is how do we know. Because we're constantly nailing this down as reality is there's it hurts we I have pain I can die. You know, the sense experience. And yet, I had that experience and now you can do that too at home even they sell a lot of this stuff now so, but I think you surely can go into higher end tech places like say Midway in Chicago and have these experiences. So, where where are we this is my this is what I'm asking you in the end. When when we're grounding ourselves down so hard in this reality is this really that and when we want to talk about neuroscience, we want to talk a stimulation through the neurological pathways in the brain and the nervous system. And and through optics in our optical love and and all this stuff that's going on really within the blackness of the brain and how functions on these systems of the body. I don't know how anyone can have conviction that this state that we're in right now is real. Well, I go through the whole simulation theory. Absolutely, but there's a hard science backing it. Yeah, it's. There's a lot to consume here with this conversation. And of course a technology has come a long way MIT for instance it's a good example. Even doing all these sort of experiences for a long time. The vice reader mind and of course devices that you just hook up and just with your thoughts you can control certain things and of course. There's another technology I am thinking of right now. I'm forgetting the name but I think it's something like by basically you could see through walls using Wi-Fi signals. Yes, yes. And see I think they've had that tech out for a while. Very, very much so. Yes, for a long, long time. And it is unusual. I know that and oh Jerry what happened there. You are right. I dropped my ice bag. I'm good. No, I saw you're going to ice your your foot there or leg. Are you okay Jerry? Yeah, I'm fine. I fell through my deck and bruised up my leg. It's gnarly. Yeah, it's gnarly. But that technology was if you are a believer in. I don't think it's predictive programming but what people call predictive programming. I think a similar technology displayed and I think there was one in fringe for one but mainly in the black night or the dark night rises one of the Batman movies really did this echolocation with cell phones. So yeah, that idea is pronounced. Yes, yes, yes, it's out it's seated for us. It's there and it's accessible. That's part of the magic here. That's part of the sigil is if you can get it seated into ideas. This is where artists and visionaries come in and present it to the collective and give it to them in a constructive way. They can see it. Therefore, if they can see it and visualize it, they can create it and bring it further into a deepening idea of this reality, whatever this reality may be. Otherwise, there's no, no bridging. There's no synaptic stuff happening. If there's, you know, you've got to, you've got to create the bridge. What's even weirder is that there are people who say they've had like a mutual out of body experience, which is odd in itself. Right. Well, I find those, you know, my mind goes back, of course, romantically to to the old, which is Sabbath. And we're, you know, where they're meeting out of body, but monks do this and people who really focus in on the inner space. This is, this is a practice that's been in the world. I've, I've read about orders of nuns doing this. And, you know, it's usually people that are having, for lack of a better word, hermetic lives are hermitated lives or monastic lives where they're, they're intentionally stepping away from the collective, the chatter, if you will, of the collective. And, therefore, these other realms are easier to access if you're not being bombarded with stimuli all the time, which is part of what I think some of this fuckery in our world is now. Right. This overlay seems to be getting thicker. And now with like people like Elon Musk and his, you know, Skynet, whatever he's calling that. What is that thing called above us it's happening Starlink Starlink. Mr. Deacon, did we lose you. No, I'm here. I was just saying of the other thing he was creating the neural link. Yes. Right. And look at the link is in everything. It's actually called the BCI. The BCI. Okay. That's what it is. The brain computer interface. But it's it's it's it's commonly known though. You know, so it's got it's out in the public is coming on. It's like with the Hadron colliders everyone just thinks turn right. Well, there are several turns the biggest. Yeah, there's a bunch of them out there. There's one here in Washington. I'm interested. I'm really interested in seeing what happens with the lawn mask going to the future here. With the narrow link, the chip that would be implanted directly into the skull. I postulate that he's already done it. I believe so. If they're talking about doing it, that means they already did it. Exactly. Isn't that that's always part of the that's part of that. That presenting it to others. Hypothesis that I was talking about earlier. So it's well, but it questions this reality, Michael. Of course. Yes. Eventually they're going to want to do that where they sort of download consciousness into a machine of sorts. I think it's already happened. I believe that AI hit it so that horizon and it's we're having causality loops in all direction. We'll have to talk to a Chinese person though for that. Daily technology in AI. That's why I know I said there's part of me that's like, you know, a lot of oftentimes I've heard so many. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I think it's a lot of people who are in the world. I've actually heard someone say that the Asian race is a. I'm not going to say it all out. Never mind. Never mind. These times. Yeah, I don't feel like being canceled tonight for this. But I heard someone else say, no, I, so if you can pull up to the idea that some people have AI souls, if you will, that that's what's going on with the Asians that they, they have AI souls. Interesting. Well, I mean, my co host brought up Christopher Columbus and I was thinking, why are you asking me about Christopher Columbus for? I mean, you know, he did quite well in his travels, but it was actually the Chinese who discovered America. Could have been. Nobody knows. And even if they do know, they're not going to tell us because it goes against the narrative. I want to quote, it seems like they might have. I mean, they have the oldest of marks out there. Yes, I'd hear in America. If you look at some of the findings that Chinese explorers may have discovered America long before Europeans arrived here. I kind of fucks up the whole out of Africa narrative though, which kind of does it does. Yeah, I mean, it can't be real. Yeah, there are a few disrupting with evidence with, you know, archaeological evidence that disrupt the ad Africa narrative. And certainly, everyone's holding on to their stories. That's part of the problem with this reality is how you know this is all stories and we're all holding on to what most people are holding on to their stories. And that seems to be part of the fuckery with, and you know these indoctrination programs these cultish programs that we see through different organizations from schooling to, you know, different religious orders. And I'm wondering, we are at that, that mark, this went really fast. Yeah, it's almost time to end this right. And I know don't get too excited baby. Jerry, do we have questions? Not yet. I guess nobody's got questions for the deacon. Even better. Michael. I think I'm going to drink a bottle of beer here I'll be good. Oh, nice. What are you drinking. I think I have some space dust in the works here. Oh, okay. Nice little IPA waiting for me. Mm hmm. You're kind of an IPA guy. Don't let us stop you from enjoying it. Please. I'm just here at the end. I know I'm just too far away from the fridge. Oh, you're tethered. I need to buy like a mini fridge. Yes, and park it near your room. Yeah, that'd be a great idea. You have no reason to leave your room. Exactly. All right, so I've got no questions so we can wrap. Yeah, well I got questions for you guys again. Have you been enjoying the quarantine? We'll start with you. Jerry. Absolutely not. But it hasn't changed my life. Right. It hasn't changed my life either. Definitely hasn't changed mine. Have I enjoyed it because hasn't changed my life. I haven't derived anything from it but the idea of it is bothersome. So, like the idea that there's a power structure behind locking us up in our, you know, that idea I don't like because I don't like the idea of being covered period and like the channel idea. So, but no, and you know, as far as people around me social distancing has been a way of my life. It's always coming. Yeah, I just see it all as a lot of programming for, you know, for a lot of nasty shit to come down the pike. I see. And another question I have is, why did you choose this project and as it turned out, the way you wanted to. Yeah. The why, as I've explained so many times is that we wanted to do a podcast but didn't want to have a regular podcast, quote unquote conspiracy podcast like everyone else who has the same guests on over and over to talk about their latest book or whatever. We wanted to talk to these people but explore different angles with them. So, just came up with the dream idea. And it all kind of came out of that. It was very organic we just decided to do something and made it happen. And one of our goals was, as Jerry just said that kind of more natural. And conversations and not be tied down to having just to discuss, you know, so and so's latest book. Yeah. Yes. We wanted this intimate feel like we're hanging out and we like these are our normal conversations in life. So, this wasn't even a stretch for us. We're not like how's your hair doing kind of people. Yeah. Yeah, I'm with you on that normal Montauk no doubt and for me. Yeah. It's been a continuous uphill battle with the same media to run these networks that we all know so well those and premiere those in the higher and lower levels. I've had my run ins with a lot of these folks. But that's another hour or two to fully explain those comments but I could absolutely and systematically and diametrically decipher all this for you. But I digress. And I agree with Jerry, you know, I must say I really, you know, I like the show a lot. It's quite unique. I appreciate that you guys are doing this and I agree with Jerry as well that everyone has a podcast everyone and their, their mothers has a show now. And the reality is most of the fold, most will fold after a number of episodes it takes a certain maniac with a very unbelievable drive to make this work and I've been able to accomplish a few things with my euphonious way of speaking, and the being completely perspiracious. You like that word. I do. Michael. I've created a cult and this is especially difficult if you're not a celebrity or at least I've been on TV or terrestrial radio. It's been a very difficult uphill battle but I've been able to do quite well for myself to be honest. I've been on the ground on networks. And so, that's where, you know, one of the things Jerry and I like to speak the way we want so if we want if there's an F bomb we want to let the F bomb go. Let her fly. Yeah. We don't like we're not into censorship and we're definitely open source type of people. And so which I guess makes us now very dangerous. I heard that before echoed before. Yes, I think again it's very difficult, especially when others want to derail you at every turn and I've experienced that time and time again. Again, from those from the lowest of lows to the highest of highs, you name it on the names that you know of lots of them completely petty. And that's how most human beings are extremely petty so never let that surprise you out there boys and girls. Words of truth. The amount of that humans have. Well that you know it's funny though because people that become that come into this space with us are. I mean, you know, by the calm, the level of interaction we have is just at a different level. And so the pettiness is really something you just have to be such a hardcore hater to sit through. Otherwise we're having good conversations with a lot of interesting people. And, and as I've always said, I do not give a fuck about your titles. I just don't care we're here to talk about you and your opinions and how you're moving through the world around you and how you're experiencing it. And it is truly about let's shed that all that stuff at the door. I don't want it. I don't care about it. I'm glad people feel invested in their accomplishments. It's awesome. And I don't want to belittle that also but when we're coming into aspect like this, let's just let's see where we can take it and get you're not writing a paper. I don't need citations and, you know, don't bog us down with all that. Let's just let's get naked and have fun. I love that but yes, I agree. I subscribe to that notion. The last censorship the better that it's people like those who are authentic, no doubt. All right. Well, yeah, that's an essential. Jerry, I just want to say thank you again, Michael for coming on the show. It's been great to have you. And we hope to have you back on an obelisk sometime, which we can go into some of the weird non dream stuff. Yeah, I could get into into that further here and I do want to thank both of you for giving me this opportunity to run my mouth here with you guys. Great. And thanks everyone for listening and be sure to tune in next week we have an obelisk show with Shane bales Shane the ruler. We're going to go balls deep on some really interesting shit so that should be a great show I can't wait for that. So anything else. And so I just want to thank you Michael because I know you don't do interviews and so I'm thrilled that you came over to the space. And allowed us some some time with you. I feel, you know, it's, it's definitely a big thank you. And also for the people that don't know where they find you. Well, they can go to Michael Deacon calm or simply go to YouTube and type in Michael Deacon and that includes iTunes, Stitcher, and a cast box which I prefer. You can simply go there and you'll find myself there and my co host at times who does the program with me. They wanted only my kitties. And we do a pretty good job out there. We have fun. And we are a open platform for all to discuss their thoughts and ideas with absolutely no censorship whatsoever rather and we are not PC at all. That's awesome. I want to get Michael on our show. Will you ask him. I don't ask him. Mike, Mike, not Mike. You're Mike. He's also someone who doesn't like doing interviews like I do like pulling teeth. You know, I don't really like doing interviews but this but this wasn't an interview and I sure. He'll enjoy the lounge or here. Yeah, definitely for sure. What I mean by that is, you know, I prefer having this sort of discussion with you guys as well, which is why I agree to do it. But other shows I've actually turned down a bunch. To be honest, I probably shouldn't have though. Well, I know you have. That's why I'm thanking you. So, all right, then that note. I love it. Thank you so much guys. We'll do it again. No doubt. That definitely. Thank you, Michael. Thanks guys. And we'll talk to you next week. Take care. Mahalo.

Our goal is to help in the process of bringing conscious intent to the state of dreaming â light to the shadowy corners of this experience we all have access to, each time we drift off to sleep.We strive to maintain an open and neutral environment as hosts. There are many theories on the process of dreaming and altered states, and we want to hear them all. No information is irrelevant when it comes to dreams.

      "{'transcript': \" (upbeat music) Welcome to this episode of This Epic Life. I'm Bailey Bena Andrade here with CEO of Epic Education, Dr. Nancy Dome. And today we have Casa Muhammad here to share her story with us. Casa is the co-founder of Shift, which is a consulting company addressing the major cultural shifts in the wake of the Me Too movement by creating spaces for honest dialogue, understanding, and change. She's also an actress and creative. So, Casa, thank you so much for coming and spending some of your quarantine time with us. (laughing) - It is my pleasure to talk to you all. So thank you for having me on. - Absolutely. So just to begin, we would love to hear what was it that motivated you to found Shift? - Absolutely. So it came about right in the middle of the Me Too movement at that time. I, my background is also in comedy and TV film work. And I remember sitting, Me Too had just hit the fan. I remember sitting around with some folks in my comedy team and there was, you know, allegations and talks of what sexual assault prevention met within a comedy community and specifically an improv community. And I just saw such a yearning for folks to want to talk about it, but not having the tools on how to talk about it. Tailing brave enough to talk about it and not knowing what sort of being so uncomfortable with the discomfort. And at that same time, simultaneously, Villeen, another co-founder, she's a good friend of mine, back from one of my mates, UCLA together. She was a lecturer at that time at UCLA and also working with one of their departments to put on an intro to privilege power and oppression 101 for the incoming freshmen. And at that time, she had pulled me into the conversation to help MC and host the show. And from there, we kind of looked at each other and also there was my other, one of my other best friends when middle school who had just moved into town and was doing D&I work training work with an organization called Asians Advancing Justice and all the pieces just fit together at that time, us wanting a space that we could create for, it's a half the same conversations that we were having amongst ourselves and our peers and bringing in all these strengths and create this D, E and I and sexual harassment prevention training company and consulting firm. And we also felt like it was important that we wanted to step into the space as wholly ourselves, as three women of color, an apologetic about it and be able to speak about these conversations in a way that brought in our backgrounds of racial justice, gender justice and social justice and in our experiences, we've been used to hearing, you know, sexual harassment trainings from usually white lawyers and suits. So how can we humanize these conversations and step into it in our own way? - Nice. And so do you primarily do trainings for like in the industry in the, or do you do trainings for anybody? - Yeah, at this moment, where we're all over from, (laughing) at universities to working with nonprofits or larger corporations. A little bit of everything. (laughing) - Nice. And do you incorporate the comedy piece in that? I mean, is that part of it or is it completely separate? - Yeah, so what we do is we want to be super intentional about also bringing up these topics in a way that allow us to step out of our, just our mind space. So walking into it with hard space and consciousness of the body. So through that, we tie in improv games and also storytelling and poetry and theater of the oppressed modules to better understand these ideas that can feel very abstract. - Right, to help meet people where they're at. I think that's a very big piece to it. Yeah, and I- - Oh, I'm sorry, Bailey, go ahead. - I was just gonna say, I appreciate how you said one of the reasons that motivated you to create shift was to create a language behind it. Because we've talked before about how people have felt these issues or this oppression for a while, but they didn't know how to put the words to it, to explain what they were experiencing and how to get around that, right? And figure it out. - Yeah. - And I also appreciate the idea of using, theater and using other tools to help people get to those places that are usually really difficult to get to you. And I value what you said about getting out of the headspace and kind of including the whole body and the experience, because that's where we have these experiences, right? But we're so used to compartmentalizing them and detaching them from the, like what does it trigger in me? Like, this is really what I'm talking about, my heart and my, you know, my gut or wherever I feel it, but we intellectualize it and we just talk about it. And I think that it's, you know, that's why we have such a hard time finding words for our experiences. - Right. - Because I don't know that there's enough words, you know, at least in English for me, that can convey sometimes the feelings that arise through different experiences. - Yes, absolutely. I feel the same way. And sometimes I feel like these words are almost kept from us. And in learning them, it's this feeling of, oh, this feeling isn't just with me. It's not something in my head. It's a universal experience. I remember hearing the term imposter syndrome and learning more about it. And then finally being able to have a word of, this is why the way I am the way I feel in certain spaces, specifically maybe more corporate spaces or in white-centered faith spaces. And in the words, I feel like there's so much validation and affirmation and the knowledge is the first part of being able to unpack it. - Absolutely. So a lot of the work you do, it's similar to how Epic goes about consulting and training and stepping into those spaces to build dialogue, right? So I'm just curious, how would you say the experiences have been coming into a room of people that have not really been introduced to these topics before and opening it up to them? Like, what has been the response? (laughing) - Right. (laughing) - Right. - Let us all have a moment with that. (laughing) - Yeah, I laugh because it's something that, we talk about a lot, meeting folks where they're at and being able to step in in a way that actually makes a difference to them. And what does it mean to us to maybe amongst ourselves have a more anti-racist lens, but step into a room and have to step in and acknowledge the fact that many of these folks don't have any of those foundations and be able to lay the foundations for them. And the way that our process works and what we try to keep in mind for ourselves and our clients is that we are here to plant a seed and be able to plant a seed for the various work to grow and that it's an ongoing conversation. And this kind of these waves of gentle resistance of going back at it and we see it in phases as, you know, the phases we see it in as is education which then can lead to action. But then there's also that element of healing that needs to take place after education because a lot of this education can be scary, fragility comes up, a lot of wounds are opened, so there needs to be healing that's done and then the action and then community building because it needs community to continually sustain it. So this constant zoom in and zoom out of what's going on from the individual to the collective to the institutional and then going back in again, it's just this pulse. - Yeah, I like that. I like the notion of this pulse because it's a journey and I think that's part, we're just having this conversation that I think a lot of people approach this work as if, okay, I've done it and now I'm checked and I'm better, you know, like, or I'm not this or, and it's this idea that it's like a spiral where every time you re-experience it, you get to go deeper, right? And you get to, it's the onion like peel away more of the defenses that you had in place and actually get to, you know, whether it's a wound or whatever it is, but you don't just dive in, right? It's this kind of cyclic experience and it's ongoing and I think that's probably been at least from our standpoint, one of the biggest challenges of doing this work is that people want it to be done. It's like they think it's something to do as opposed to like the way of being, which is the way I just, like for me, equity is not something to do, it's who I am, right? It's part of my identity, it's part of how I think and how I feel and the choices I make and really getting people to understand that that's when we're talking about DEI, that we're really talking about how we live and the choices we make, it's not a checklist. - And I appreciate you saying this idea of like, it's not what I do, it's how I live and that really resonates as well. Something we say is this, the personal is political and the political is personal. Not politics isn't parties or whatever, but just the systems of power and it's, I feel so grateful to have this work because of the amount of consistent checking and the assistant amount of internal consciousness, awareness that I have to pull on myself and to have a team of folks like my co-founders to check me on it. - Yeah, absolutely. And I appreciate that too, because I get called on a regular basis like the expert and I resist that because I don't feel like an expert, I'm a part of the journey with you, right? And so I may be just a little further along because of my lived experiences and the choices that I've made, but we are constantly being exposed to our own issues and the mayor is being put up in front of us in a regular basis. And if we're willing to look, even those of us who have chosen to lead for equity also have to be learners in that work as well. - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, great point. Now we're gonna go on the other side of things. So once you have done the work with your clients, like how does that shift in their work culture? How have you seen that manifest? - It can look like a lot of different things. I believe for every work culture, it's different. A lot of the times from the specifics that come to mind is in the ways that it manifests is greater alignment with the leadership, even just having a better idea of what is our, we call it, what is our approach to solidarity? Like what do we think of what this brand wants to be like? So are we coming at it from a place where we're like Ben and Jerry's and we're taking risks and putting dope stuff out there that stands in solidarity with folks? Or are we maybe on another side of it where we are just learning and that's fine too. So it looks and manifests itself to in alignment, manifests itself in work culture that allows for better hiring and better retention. Also, open spaces and this idea of conversation and largely, I feel like the leadership consistently being able to check themselves and go back and see what are we actually creating? - Yeah, that notion of vulnerability and I think that's probably the biggest struggle, right? Is for leadership to be willing to be vulnerable in that journey as well and not need to have all the answers and be open to being seen as imperfect, right? And knowing that we can move forward together. And I know in founding Epic, that's, I think that's one of my goals is to make sure that as the CEO that I'm as transparent as possible in my own journey around this, like I don't have all the answers and a lot of this were co-creating together and creating that space and just kind of imagining what it would be like. I mean, the reason I ended up here was not because I had some grand desire to be a business owner. It's because the institutions that I was in before didn't meet my needs. And in a lot of ways, I felt suffocated and stifled. And so I figured out that the best way to create an environment that was that made me whole was to create it rather than looking for it, right? And so just try to make that connection. - I dig that and that makes me think of how, even among shift and I'd love to hear how what y'all have found in Epic, but it feels like this, we're asking ourselves, what does it mean to decolonize the DE in iSpace? And where, how do we create a corporation that centers a community culture amongst maybe working with clients and living in a world that doesn't center basically a world that operates off of, you know, white supremacist values of certain things, whether that's like perfectionism or this idea of individualism. - Yeah, totally. And how do, for us, it's a constant conversation and particularly with quarantine going on as many as question these things more and things have kind of come to a halt. I'm curious how that is for y'all or what you've navigated along. - Yeah, well, I mean, it's just that, you know, the notion of, you know, for us individualism and as opposed to collectivism, right? And how this idea that there's no lack that we're all in this together and that, you know, that when you are successful, I am successful. So even though we do the same work, it would, I would be happy the more I know about you to say, you know what, this is a better, a resource for you because of how they do it and based on what you need. And I find that if we, we're seeing it now, you know, I all throughout, my little pet peeve right now has been the small business loans, you know, the, and who got them and who, you know, and who didn't. And so we talk about access and who you know. And this notion that, you know, greed has kind of superseded our kind of, I would like to believe it's our natural state of caring for each other and making sure that we're all good, right? And so I think that that's our, one of our challenges, this idea that we think we're separate from each other. And so, and this is equity to me. I mean, you can demean me as a black woman or you as a Muslim or you as whatever because you think we're separate, you think we're different, right? And we may have different cultural backgrounds, but we're not, we're not different in our core of who we are as people, right, as humans. And so, but we have to, I think that the dissonance for me is always having to focus on the differences that separate us because other people allow them to separate us instead of really being able to focus on the truth, which is that we are all connected, right? And so when my spirit, you know, I long for the day where my spirit and my work are truly merged together because I get to do that work. - That's beautiful. - Yeah. - And the idea of the liberation being bound together and these true definitions of solidarity and being able to, I like, be putting them towards the work in itself and solidarity amongst each other in a workspace or in a corporate space, that's beautiful. - Yeah. We've been doing this book club, the quarantine book club, The Epic. And it's been really interesting 'cause we were reading Small Great Things by Jodi Pico. And it's a great novel that really gives some insight into what it's like to be a person in our society that has microaggressions and is experiencing them on a daily basis. And we realize after like breaking it down for a long time that the two things that seem to motivate people the most, especially in our culture is self-interest and fear. And how that's just the perfect breeding grounds for a awful storm of all this institutionalized racism that we see, all of these, this corporate greed, like all this breakdown that's going on in our society, you can pretty much go down to the root and see it's either someone that's carrying more for their own self-interest, even though they know that it's toxic for the majority and the fear of not understanding, whether it's another person's culture or another person's upbringing or anything. - Right. - Yeah. - Absolutely. And that makes me think of the ties to racial capitalism and when we're taught that, you know, it's your job to make sure that you rise up and that you take what you want versus this idea of if we all help each other get what we want then we'll all rise together. - Right, that's right. And I wonder, I mean, I feel like in my lifetime, you know, which now seems significant that we've had these opportunities to do better, right? I feel like 9/11 was one of those opportunities. I'm not sure we did, I think initially we did and then I think we lost it. And I feel like this is another opportunity for us to really truly move in the direction of who we truly are as people because I think what we've recognized in this isolation is how much we need each other, right? And how much we dependent and how connect that we really are. Like if nothing else can demonstrate connectivity, this has, you know? Yeah, I'm super hopeful. Like I'm using this as an opportunity to see what could be if we truly reflect and learn from this experience and then use it to move us in a direction that's more wholesome, you know, together. - Yeah, absolutely. I'm excited by this opportunity for personal work that I feel like, or at least in my communities and feeling a lot of people talking about their own reflections and their own ability to pause and looking at the way that systems have informed the way that we've previously lived and really thinking about what does that mean when we come back from this? And like what do we want to create from here? And amidst all the scariest and the sadness going on, I'm grateful for that. - Yeah, yeah, I like that. - Absolutely. And it's awesome that there are companies like Epic and Shift and a lot of the other people that we've interviewed, right, that these foundations are now here. We have this language that we are co-creating with each other. And this is the time to rise, to really get into those companies and realize this is where we can make the difference. - Yeah, yeah, it's beautiful. No, we thank you, Kosser, for everything that you do and that you do with your team and just wish you great success and are so grateful for this time that you spent with us just to talk about kind of where we are and what you're doing. We are in gratitude. - Absolutely, and thank you both, Nancy and Bailey. This was so lovely and it's inspiring to see what you all are up to and very fueling.

Blueire. Let\\'s park this ship. And I don\\'t have metronome on, so that\\'s going to be a huge improvement from last week already. Even though I feel like that really set the tone for like a mixtape of some sort, dropping at some point. Yeah, it was like a very, very, very long skit. The ideal skit length time is five minutes You were trying to like co-opt Phoebe Bridger\\'s dropping her new album. You know, I just can\\'t have like the way, way, way cooler, much more successful and actually nothing much like me, versioned with me, getting all the spotlight. You haven\\'t listened yet, have you? I haven\\'t. Probably gonna listen to it tonight. Just turn off all the lights, fly on the floor and see what happens. I gotta say, that sounds like something that an Ally McBeal character would do to like have a realization, but it would be to like the song Torn. Instead, you\\'re gonna be listening to like songs about family trauma and sexual violence. So, exactly. So it\\'s just really gonna set the tone for my weekend. Welcome back to our Phoebe Bridger\\'s recap podcast, Puckbunnies. Dude, I\\'m Christina, by the way. I\\'m Audrey. Anyway, so we would get so many more listeners This was just us talking about Phoebe Bridger. It\\'s deconstructing one song a week from, what\\'s her what\\'s her new album called Punisher from Punisher for the next 10 weeks. We could do it. I sometimes feel very bad for people who follow me for like any other, just any, any reason. Like if you follow me for any reason, you\\'re gonna be disappointed. Right, because 95% of the other stuff is not stuff that you\\'re gonna be interested in. And it\\'s the same way with you, right? Yes, absolutely. It\\'s a venn diagram of 1% and it\\'s me. Yeah, so like I think this week or last week, Audrey texted me like she prefaced the text before she sent me the actual information. She was like, I need you to pretend to be excited about this. And I was like, all right, I\\'m primed. And she was like, Sean Hannity is dating. Is dating Ainsley Earhart from Fox and Friends. Sean Hannity, the Amelia Earhart and not immediately interested. You like valiantly though pretended that it was a big deal, which I appreciate. And that\\'s why friends, they\\'re your most important deepest relationships in life. That\\'s right. Actually, I do believe that now like unironically. Anyway, let\\'s get to the hockey. Yeah. Welcome back to Puckbunnies. Another week where none of us are supposed to be here right now and nothing that\\'s happening is supposed to be happening. Brought to you by Blue Wire. Well, just another week in Paradise. Just we, I feel like by the time this comes out, how many players by the time this comes out on Monday? Do you think it\\'s what? Friday night right now? We\\'ll get this out on Sunday night or Monday morning about two minutes before we sat down to record the NHL release statement telling us that 11 players have now tested positive for COVID-19. And that\\'s not counting staff. That\\'s not counting arena staff. That\\'s not counting anybody outside of professional National Hockey League players. Just the assets. And these are just the assets that have been tested. Right. So I think there\\'s been two, there\\'s been around 200 players tested so far. So that\\'s, I can\\'t do fractions famously, but that doesn\\'t seem like it\\'s a good amount. Well, it\\'s 5%. It\\'s a lot. I don\\'t know. Fuck it. I didn\\'t, I\\'m not sure to do division. But the issue to me isn\\'t this. It\\'s just, so I was reading the phase two guidelines for like how players were supposed to handle going from self quarantine to their team city. They just said you guys figured out. Do what feels right? No, listen, this is ridiculous. Like they tell, they give them a $1,500 travel voucher. That\\'s very nice. No, it\\'s not. No, because there\\'s like, but they have to get the completely hermetically sealed, you know, as per their agreement. So what\\'s going to happen is there\\'s going to be like a private jet coming from Stockholm. Yeah, they\\'re all going to carpool together with five beautiful typhoid marries. Just crawling with coronavirus. It\\'s going to be the knee lander, well, not Alex. Alex. Alex. Yeah, it\\'s going to be Elias. It\\'s going to be William knee lander, gay blandest gog. Oh my gosh. I\\'m just trying to think of like five beautiful blonde Swedes. Elias Lindhope, both Elias. Yes. Yes. It\\'s just ridiculous to think about these angelic boys. So these blonde just gods of men coming in on this Vikings like Apollo coming in on this private jet. Cuz we\\'re all late with the play because Sweden has just been like, fuck it. We ball. Let\\'s figure it out. It\\'s fine. So it\\'s Friday. Today started with TSN\\'s Bob McKenzie revealing that he had found out that at least one NHL club had had to temporarily close its training facilities during this phase two period because multiple players and some staff had tested positive for coronavirus. Very shortly after that, we learned that it is the Tampa Bay Lightning. The boys, they\\'re back in town and they\\'re breeding. This is not shocking. Obviously, I feel like last week when we lightheartedly made the prediction, the league is not going to slow down and grab the wall at any point until somebody is hospitalized or dead. I wasn\\'t being dramatic. I really do know that. I really feel like that we were just sibbles in that moment. We\\'re like, we\\'re just telling you this because it I mean just on this small, small, small scale of like just trying to make hockey come back during the end of the world. It has been like a gaslighting experiment of just unprecedented nature because everyone has handed these plans with just there\\'s no guidelines for how to make any of these players do anything. Also, I\\'m not a lot of consideration for the safety of the players at all. It\\'s just not going to happen. We all saw that we pat and like this is not going to happen. But we all pretend it like it did. It\\'s like a terrarium of the United States public policy response to this crisis. It\\'s like if you really want to get a look at how the US is handling coronavirus, just study the NHL for a little bit because what they\\'re just doing, it\\'s ignoring it. Yeah, and like it\\'s weird to have this event horizon happening so cataclysmically across every aspect of our life. Just because you know, I think that these are things that you and I have come to know about the world that it sucks and it\\'s this unfair and that capital always, you know, serves to hurt the most people possible through a lot of like introspection and thought. I never thought I\\'d be in the cool zone. Here we are. Now let\\'s Obecian is going to get hospitalized with COVID. So once it came out that the club was Tampa Bay Lightning, I think they said that three was the three or six players. Three players. But the cherry on top of the Sunday, of course, is I just get a text from Audrey. Like I\\'m in the middle of a meeting. It just says Austin Matthews has it. I almost like had to mute my microphone just like let out just a scream. We talked about this last week. I was like, it\\'s gonna have to be a star and they\\'re gonna have to get really sick and oh my god one flat week later. So yes, according to one source in Canadian media, Austin Matthews has allegedly tested positive for coronavirus. So Austin Matthews was quarantining in Arizona with friend of the pod. Friend of the pod ready Anderson who has tested negative for coronavirus. Allegedly, allegedly. Okay, here\\'s the thing. I\\'m trying to take this story with a grain of salt just because it does like obviously it\\'s sensitive medical information and there\\'s a lot of debate online because you know it\\'s how does it affect the leaves? Everybody\\'s freaking out over the ethics of whether or not you can report on somebody\\'s like medical testing records. And I believe student of journalism here that it does not violate HIPAA but it still is a shitty thing to do. As a lawyer, we\\'re actually two very good people to be talking about this now that I\\'m thinking about it. As a lawyer, it should only ask us about this. As an attorney, it really depends on how it was found out that he was positive because as if it was someone who had access to his medical records and then told somebody else, that would be a HIPAA violation. Like if it was a nurse, I was like, \"Oh my God, Austin Matthews has coronavirus.\" So what likely happened is that he texted it to a family and then a family person linked it. Someone he knows leaked it or like, you know, he told a girl, he told some girl in the Instagram DMs and she had it. So again, the Leafs have now released a statement saying we\\'re not going to comment on this. So to me, that means that he has. I\\'m like, \"Yeah!\" I\\'m like, \"Yeah!\" He\\'s like the Leafs. So don\\'t say anything. Kyle is berating someone just in a closet. And okay, the reason that this worried me, I\\'m not even like the like, \"I want my craft, I\\'m ceasing to be true,\" is I\\'m concerned that if it\\'s already out that he has it. I hope he\\'s all right. Yeah, and I mean, like the players testing positive that we\\'ve learned about just today. This is so obvious and obviously like hindsight\\'s 2020, but they should have seen this coming. If a single person working in the NHL had any sort of like, public policy slash knowledge of the world and current events, they would say, \"Hey, maybe we should not open our training facilities back up in Florida and Arizona where cases are spiking.\" You know, I believe that and I don\\'t think that there are all, I mean, okay, like it\\'s an organization. They can\\'t all be stupid. So if you\\'re looking at what the other leagues are doing, they\\'re not the only people who are having training camps in Florida. No, absolutely. And how\\'s it working out for the Phillies who are having camp in Florida right now? They\\'re having all these camps here and you have to ask yourself, \"Why are they all having their camps there?\" And if you follow your little nose, it\\'s because they\\'re getting money to do it. They\\'re getting money to use these facilities. And what\\'s happening is they\\'re waving a lot of travel requirements and quarantine requirements for players that are coming in from Sweden and stuff like that. So if Elias Pederson was trying to come to like New York, he would have to quarantine for two weeks, but now it basically bypasses that two week period and he can go straight to train camp. So this leads us to how they\\'re trying to proceed and choose the hub cities for in our mind palaces what we think of as the playoffs that are definitely going to happen this summer. Yes. So the Canadian US border is still closed. Basically anybody who\\'s traveling and they\\'re a quote unquote essential worker or so, professional athletes are included in this. Right now Canada\\'s policy is that if you enter Canada, you have to quarantine yourself for 14 days. They just took care of that. They basically made an exception so they could move it to Vancouver or Toronto. The other issue that gives me pause is like looking at the race in Vegas. Yeah. And thinking about how bad the NHL is at putting on any sort of event. I\\'m thinking about the All-Star game for example. And how are they going to manage to corral these like wild horses into their barns if they\\'re already getting sick at training? They\\'re going to have to clear out the entire strip. They should just get everybody, all the civilians who live in Vegas are going to have to leave. The National Guard comes out like three months. Oh my god. No. And this is what\\'s interesting is that I think now today what people have started saying is like, okay, the league is now looking at just having their hub cities in Canada because the US can\\'t even begin to start getting its shit together. And it doesn\\'t look like that\\'s in the near future. So maybe it\\'ll just be Toronto and Vancouver. It feels very weird because do you have anything? Well, no, I was thinking about this today. Do you remember like the 2004 Olympics when they were like, Athens is it going to do it? And then it\\'s like, so cheap, they\\'re not going to do it. And like, and now it\\'s us. Yeah. Because it turns out that you have to have a functioning society to seamlessly pull off many sports events at one time. Right. And I think for the US that is going to be pulling off the NBA playoffs in Disney World. Would love to see it. That is apparently what they\\'re going to be doing. They\\'ve already released the names of the teams and where they would be probably staying. And it sounds great. Like that plan, it\\'s not going to work, but it sounds like a lot of fun. I like that castle. It\\'s constructed like that mine castle has much better foundation. You know, they really thought about the flying buttresses and stuff. The NHL\\'s mine palace playoffs just pile of shit. Isn\\'t nightmare. It\\'s a hut surrounded by a moat. We\\'re all swimming in it. It sucks. This week, hero, Puckbuddy\\'s hero, new friend of the pod, Roman Polak. Oh my God. Said an example that I think, I mean, I would be shocked now if more players don\\'t follow what he did. So I\\'ve been getting up very early in the morning just for no reason. And I think I wrote up Audrey just saying Roman Polak has just left America. So he literally said fuck it and left and he\\'s not coming back for the playoffs. He was already in the Czech Republic. Roman Polak just for the people who are not star sets, he was up for free agency this summer, but he was assumedly going to come back to play the playoffs. But he decided no, he was not going to be coming back to America and has renounced the NA show and his contract and will remain on the continent. If this is an unfamiliar name to you, that might be because Roman Polak is 34 years old. And he was a healthy scratch in like the last eight games of the last like 20 that the star has played. So he\\'s a depth guy. He\\'s a depth guy for sure. Okay, but like if someone who\\'s it who\\'s made it in the show, like Roman Polak is quitting. This is like not super great for a lot of the other depth guys in the NHL who could go and play and weird ass leagues and Norway or something like that. So what the NHL doesn\\'t want to happen is they don\\'t want like all these other guys who are looking at free agency in the next couple of years to be like well shit my team isn\\'t gonna make the playoffs. There\\'s no guarantee that they\\'re gonna have a season until like next year. Next January. Yeah. And so like why don\\'t I just go play in my normal country like socialized medicine because people can go watch me play. I can hear the crowds roar my name again.

That\\'s one word B-L-U-E-W-I-R-E. Bet online your online wagering experts. So we got a text this week from a listener who just said I don\\'t have a question. I just wanted to say that you guys should apply to the Sabers assistant GM jobs. I agree. I feel like we would do it very cheaply which seems to be the issue up there right now. Well so how much do you know about the ownership of the Buffalo Sabers? I know that the pegulas are married. They are power couple. They are freckers. They got that fracking money. They have that natural gas money. Yes. Kim lean in feminist euro is president of the sabers and I think he\\'s president of the bills correct. So the pegula family bought the Buffalo sabers in 2011. Yes. This was at the height of like the fracking boom and like wait for if you were fracking natural gas in America. It was like a good time to be doing that. So he was incredibly flush with cash and he literally said in his like one of his first press conferences. There might be a salary cap but there\\'s no salary cap on talent. So his goal was to really this and this is ironic considering how bad they are, how bad their debt is. Is he wanted to develop their scouting? Yes. And he wanted to develop their farm leagues. Now I don\\'t know if you guys have been paying attention to natural gas markets. In the last like 10 years or so it\\'s not been good to be a frecker. So not only morally but also financially. Financially is what we care about here. But yeah, I mean he\\'s already in hell and he\\'s going to be burned on natural gas. So he has lost a shitload of money and what\\'s very interesting about the time when he bought the sabers is that\\'s around the time when the rickets were trying to acquire the cubs. And so this was a time whenever investment companies and hedge funds were pitching sports franchises to incredibly wealthy people as this basically a way to print money. And so that\\'s why you know like someone at Deadspend wrote a really great piece about the rickets scandal and like just how messed up all that was. But that\\'s what Olgaarik\\'s did in the late aughts is the butt spore. Brought teams baby. Unfortunately when you play in Buffalo you got to be good or people aren\\'t going to come. Right. So it became sort of a death spiral of both his own. So the other thing that he didn\\'t do that was really interesting is Kim. I do want to say like before we get into this any further we\\'re talking about this like the pigoulas died or something. That\\'s not why we\\'re talking about the sabers. We\\'re talking about the sabers because this week Jason Bauderel there GM got fired like three weeks after they released a statement saying oh no Jason\\'s going to stay on like he\\'s our GM. He\\'s our guy. But that but that like it\\'s perfect lead into like their leadership style. So like Kim and so Mr. and Mrs. Figula run its run a tight ship. She is just president of hockey operations and then they just kind of do it together. Yeah. Love a mom and pop shop. They basically fired everybody. They fired everybody. They had to rehire a couple people. I believe they accidentally fired like an accountant or somebody. No their IT got their IT got their special vice president and towards an IT they\\'re like oh fuck you\\'ve got the password. We\\'re locked out of the CMS we can\\'t get back in. They fired Jason Bauderel. They fired their assistant GMs. They fired the head coach of the HL team their assistant HL coaches and the director of their scouting program and a lot of his guys. So like that\\'s sort of what I was talking about is their investment in amateur scouting was just really weird by league sanders. And so I don\\'t I wasn\\'t I wasn\\'t a hockey fan in 2011. So I didn\\'t really know I didn\\'t read about any of this until recently. But they basically spent a shill out of money just sending random dues out to games. And so like his his little network of little birds they\\'re all dead. We\\'re going to like watch 50 berry Colts games in the middle of the winter. It\\'s rough because I feel like as a fan base it\\'s very easy to blame GMs and coaches and much harder to conceive of like blaming owners because owners are oftentimes not very hands-on. And they\\'re so fucking rich. I do want to say that like since the Pagula\\'s bought the team it\\'s been 10, 9 years, 6 head coaches. They\\'re on their 6 head coach and they\\'re on their 4th GM. So at that point I just have trouble believing oh it\\'s a coaching problem. Oh it\\'s a management problem. Well but so funny is that like it\\'s such a starter billionaire move to buy a hockey team because like hockey is one of the few sports where you honestly cannot buy your way until the championship team very quickly. So like if you are if you are a real billionaire you would go and buy a team like on the Premier League and like soccer because then like there\\'s no salary cap and that\\'s what like to do with Manchester City. And you can also do that with baseball. There\\'s a salary cap in hockey so you cannot do that. And so it\\'s just such a massive failure of both vision and money to have this entire network of amateur scouts trying to build up like a farm team and not having one because that\\'s their whole problem. They have no depth. And it also so much this story has played in to the larger themes of the issues of staffing and hiring and diversity equity and inclusion in the National Hockey League. Like their replacement GM Kevin Adams he was working in their business administration department. They were just like we can give them a little raise. We have one guy left Kevin with a lie. Let\\'s go. They didn\\'t interview multiple people. They didn\\'t they didn\\'t look outside the organization. They didn\\'t probably didn\\'t even look down the hallway. Yeah because the pigulas want to be the ones who\\'s called the shots and they obviously cannot call them right. It\\'s sort of the same thing that\\'s happening in Ottawa in a lot of ways. It\\'s you have these franchises that are who are being poisoned by the people who own them who just do not give a fuck and it\\'s because the other owners do not give a fuck. So I was like reading some stuff about this earlier this week and I uh my favorite thing that somebody said was Greg Wachinsky from ESPN said uh there\\'s no one in the league who I feel worse for than Jack Eichl. That hits so hard. I love him. I feel so bad for him. And he has gotten caught up in all this too just because you know he\\'s sort of the de facto okay what do you build a team around if you have nothing you build around the star player who\\'s also the captain who\\'s also the captain and so he\\'s sort of unfairly and in my opinion his words carry a lot of weight and so he gets whiplash in the media where like do you support your coach? Do you support who would and he\\'s just like I would like you then to I would like to win please yeah can you pick some good guys? Also I feel very close to him since he\\'s Scorpio Gemini Moon. Jack Eichl was the eighth best forward in the league this year on the 25th best team. He\\'s on x-games mode every night by himself. He\\'s 23 years old and he is signed through 2026. That\\'s a long time. That\\'s Christina\\'s face. Just as she was trying to process the amount of time between now and 2026. You guys try and do that. I can\\'t even think about next week. I was gonna say I\\'m like tomorrow seems like very vague. So it\\'s a real it\\'s a mess up there. What if there was a jamboree like a bad contract jamboree like you know a dead jamboree and all the lottery teams got to like shuffle. Yeah. Whoa wait that\\'s a good idea. So you like distribute them equally like you just shuffle. So you would do this maybe in place of a draft this year since we don\\'t know if the season is restarting or not. We\\'re just gonna shuffle the guys we\\'ve already got. We\\'re gonna recede but just the teams that didn\\'t make the play. And and just Christina\\'s gonna do it and she\\'s gonna do it only using the V look up tool on excel. I\\'m not gonna I\\'m not gonna include vibes. I\\'m not gonna include where they want to play. I\\'m just doing pure talent baby and also astrological sign. Should we take some calls? Let\\'s take some calls. I bucked bunnies drawn from Saint Paul. If every time a player scored a fan died who would win the rocket Richard trophy weigh in. Thank you. So I had to Google who was that once. Yeah. Who do you have? I mean it\\'s gotta be somebody who just actively like honestly I was thinking Jack Eichl. Well I was thinking I\\'m like do I get to pick a fan base of who like if the guy who does it is the one the fans who die. So like I\\'m killing a lot of people in Buffalo. Right. I think the slow burn for me would be Mitch Marner who every time he scores another Toronto hockey dad who was tweeting at him incessantly for six months telling him to shut the fuck up and take goddamn deal would would pass away. I\\'m going galaxy brain and I\\'m gonna pick Logan couture. Okay. Win there in the playoffs because think about all the billionaires and Silicon Valley he could kill. You think that he would use his powers like he would selectively kill people. That\\'s not that can\\'t be how it works. That can\\'t be how it works. I get to pick. Right. Right. Like no we need to like actually I think like the real answer to this man\\'s question is to pick the player who doesn\\'t score ever because you don\\'t want anyone to die. Right. Oh then I would go with like I don\\'t know Kristana or somebody. It\\'s a great question though. If you want to be like a good person or whatever. Hi bunnies Lauren from Indiana here from a pure hockey perspective it was a blessing to have the red being season end early. I personally couldn\\'t take much more. However with the current season being extended teams who are eliminated from the playoffs might not play until January and your wildest dreams what would be the best way for eliminated teams to play or otherwise keep connected with fans until then. I would love to see some sort of team skills competition ranging from actual legit skills to like who can win in a hockey stick javelin throwing competition. I have a couple of concepts here. Okay good good. My favorite one is that last week when we talked about hiring plants for the crowd at playoff games it should be players from teams that did not make the playoffs. That would be so good. It\\'s a little psychologically twisted but like also could be motivational. You know what no have you seen any reality show on based on like a skill the final episode they always all come back. Let\\'s go let\\'s bring all the losers in it. Have you seen so you can dance they all stand on the stage. Also my logic here is that if you\\'re gonna already have like 500 NHL players in one hub city you might as well have all 800 of them or whatever and just keep them there in quarantine until the season can really restart and we have a vaccine or something. Whenever Audrey and I were like first becoming friends she told me to read this book Tera Knots which is about great book fantastic book about people who go and live in a dome and wow in the Nevada desert like how cool would that be. Like when I see questions like this I\\'m like the January and I struggle so much with like this is a podcast and it\\'s supposed to be funny right but right now we have to deal with the concept of time which is never funny. I don\\'t know what they\\'re gonna do they\\'re probably not gonna do much because nobody\\'s gonna be doing much until January. I hope to God that the Kachuk family continues with their wonderful nanny series. It\\'s just Brady and Taren now so I hope that they can have fun together. You know what I really hope they do what I really hope they do is they force everybody to get a GED like they\\'re in prison. Audrey just took a sip of water and she\\'s about to force education. They all have to do distance learning. All right you\\'re gonna read great expectations and then we\\'re gonna have to read an essay about it. Okay so you think that eliminated teams should be forced to go back to school. Yeah yeah well we\\'ll get them taxed credits for retraining Audrey. You can get your full salary after six weeks. Can I get a ruling on Elliot Friedman\\'s beard? I haven\\'t looked at it up I wanted to like give you my applied reaction. All right live react Christina reacting to Elliot Friedman\\'s beard for the first time. He either I don\\'t know if you can use this but he either looks like he\\'s about to cut someone\\'s head off or is it about to get cut off. The zoom camera does make him look like he is in a hostage video. Okay oh like once you get past like everything happening once you get past it. He looks like it was all been lost. He looks really good. He looks no. He looks like he looks like he looks like a professor that I was like a really good eccentric professor who would I would take like a great interest in but who would be mentored in me in a non-sexual way. Does that make sense? What a concept. Would be nice. A non-threatening man in a position of authority. Nice to meet you. Okay I\\'m gonna read you the next text. Hi bunnies we never heard which abs players have COVID although it\\'s confirmed at least three of them did. Which of the idiot abs got corona. How did they not all get it since they\\'re constantly in each other\\'s pockets? I\\'m convinced one of them was JT Comper but I\\'m not sure who the other two could have been. Please wildly speculate on this. Thanks Jess. I mean we\\'ve talked about this. They\\'ve all had it. I think they all have it. But also 99.999% certainty that one of the players who tested positive was Audre Burikovsky. Again like the beautiful lads flying over from Sweden. Like he\\'s got it. He\\'s got it. He was born with it. To like take a macro view of this. Just watching people in my neighborhood comply or not comply with various social distancing orders. I\\'m in Chicago. It\\'s like one of the most liberal cities in America. People are pretty good about it. We\\'re asking men. First of all men. Men. Men who had brain injuries to be mindful of like them of anything. I don\\'t think that most Americans like really realize how much of an undertaking that is. Especially when we were already asking them to do so in March when nobody was seeing the effects of this already. And also again like just speaking from a purely US point of view. Most of the country has not seen this affect their own communities. And they don\\'t know anybody who\\'s had the virus. They don\\'t go out and see people wearing masks. Because why would you wear a mask if nobody you know has it. Or you don\\'t have any cases in your county. Right. Because it\\'s denialism that the core of American capitalism. Right. But it\\'s also just human nature. It\\'s such a huge thing to worry about. Like it\\'s so massive. If you really let it settle that like oh I\\'m in a global pandemic and 200,000 people are going to die. At least that why would your brain not want to take you somewhere else. Where you\\'re like oh but I don\\'t why would it be me. It\\'s not going to be me. So anyway Andre Burkowski has grown up. Okay. Here\\'s here\\'s an interesting question. Do you think that any player is going to be able to use this to be able to take a stand on this kind of stuff. That\\'s what I was going to ask you. I was going to say which player do you think is going to have their third eye opened and they\\'re going to like become woke. So I think that the players who are already pretty progressive are on a precipice or something. I see Holby and I\\'m like he needs a little nudge. Actually he\\'s probably already there but he\\'s such a like he\\'s not crying. Yeah. He\\'s like I can see Jonathan Taze. I wish it was going to be somebody like really unexpected. You know what I\\'m saying. Like all this time again to return to the Dallas stars. I don\\'t think Jamie Ben ever said anything about Black Lives Matter or protests or anything but what if it\\'s because all this time he\\'s like being in his Dallas McMansion just studying pandemics and being like this is a bio weapon that the Chinese released on us that they\\'ve been planning for years and now Bill Gates is going to give us like fake vaccines that will actually spread the disease more. His third eye is just that awful eye on his teeth like cracking open but no I\\'m in break bad in like a positive way. I think it could be someone like Elias Patterson maybe. I know I just wish it was somebody who was dumb. We can all hope for like the smart bimbo but they\\'re not they don\\'t exist. There\\'s only so many smart bimbos and you and I are already taking up two of the top slots so I have two Y-claws and I get concerned about mine. Well Christina it\\'s been another delightful week of playing pretend. This is truly fantasy hockey. Yeah it\\'s like it\\'s just gaslighting hockey. It\\'s like fantasy hockey on steroids is where we\\'re just really pretending that it\\'s gonna happen. Do you ever think that we were made for this like this moment? No I think I was made for exactly the opposite of this moment like I think I was made to lie on a beach somewhere and not worry about anything and quite frankly it\\'s an injustice that\\'s that\\'s what happening. You know what I think we should just end this episode. We hope you guys are doing better than us. Seems unlikely. Seems like we\\'re all pretty much in the same spot but if you would like to call in and commiserate or send us questions for next week you can call us at 774-318-6952 please remember to rate and review us on iTunes, Spotify, the other ones. You can follow us on Twitter @PuckBunny\\'s_Pod or on Instagram @PuckBunny\\'sPod.

      "{'transcript': \" this is a show that I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Oh, everybody's here. Everybody's showing up here. It's Ben, you go here. I know. So everybody should still be chilling here and having a good time on this Monday evening here. So this is just the. To spy my stuff. I hand in control here for a second today. Night, we're going to talk about this black musical legend, this new black. Now they want to talk about. This and the racial injustice. This is some simplistic type of bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit. And I'm going to read this part of this article. I'll read pick sections that are very important that I find very, very problematic in this article. Because everyone wants to talk about all we want to have that we want to preserve black music when you guys in the industry have been desecrating it, disrespecting it and doing all the fuck you want to do with it with these Jewish handlers. Well, handlers in the music industry. All right. Always destroying black music. You are doing it in post-saver slavery. You did it with jazz. You did it with blues. You did it all. Oh, oh, oh, rock and roll. You were ripping black. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. And they want to have this little black music, whole legend, this symbolic bullshit that's that's okay. So, what is it where we go to R&B so, um, Neil so hip hop. Wherever we go with this black music we can do. Oh, there could be section at the section and it's, and it's, and at this time it's really black music month. And it's, it's despicable when we have art, when we have things like this. Now, I will say that this has to be dealt with. So I'm going to read this article to you. And you can see it in the description box. And Aria. And the other music that forms the nonprofit black music out of college on Monday. And aligns with the show must be part of the group was ensure that the music business with all the capital for a black music and black creators. Can you do the combat combat systematic race of the flea moment of up world and as an. So, see the games did usual substance, they want to fight racism when they're actually the racist themselves. If racing black musicians every time. Let's go in history. Let's take it. Let's just take it in the time of the civil rights moment. Make it all these. Let's, let's look at who do we put up there. When we. Oh, right, we put up a little Richard. Let's put up. Let's talk about cats like Elvis Presley. Yeah, that's. So you can just doing just making making music for them so they can always copy. And pillage black music. Always eating off a black creativity. Hey, funny. And during the time during that integration that integration destroying black music from within. Just do it just like they did with Studio 54. For yeah, we can go on that studio 54. When you will let it black black these white European artists. Hmm. A lot with the British since the post British invasion with you have to beatles the rolling stones. You have the doors. The strokes. Guns and roses. Yeah, let's talk about that. They all got their influences from black music. That's right. That's right. So why does it make it different today? We can't even be. And to cosy six nine. Okay, it's just still the same thing. Let's read. I want to read the whole article, but it's like I said, we'll keep playing section sections. I read it. In the open land, the college, the coalition said it was inspired by a recent effort from players like the University of Michigan. We're learning through Sony Apple YouTube and we're working in share the continued average official plan coming in the next 34. A high priority of this month is meet with each company, CEO, manager, and your newly formed foundation board. So I believe the problem where the drug dealer roots this man, raising in our industry. The coalition said adding that it was an inequality treatment. A black artist, a recruitment as my advancement and salary part of it. The black executive in general says, no, and how you're coming will make things right by black are executive in the great community. The coalition also gives the black and said how fun the distribution. No, we don't give a fuck what you have to say, because it's all crap, crap, crap. Sounds good on paper. Billy Barry, which eaten up a black culture. Cardi B. Cardi B definitely is a man. I'm going to repeat that again. And check their ads for some stupid stuff. Cardi B. Cardi B, you don't got no right. You stole from black, you stole from gangster boo. You made you were making fun of MLK's wife. It was funny written by Rick Michaels, poop we can ask. The gaga should not sign this. No way. After what you did with our Kelly, my virus cannot sign this. You've prop A black culture. No, no, no, post Malone. Oh, yeah, I'll get to him there. Myles size. Her grandfather used to work at the Federal Reserve. So that's something needs to be looked at there. Myles size was prop A black culture. No, fuck out of here. And it comes to find out people were saying that my size family got Nick, even not banned. There's been rumors that there's been rumors about that going around that that was happening. Post Malone, Mr. You don't like me. Don't listen to hip hop. This post Malone race is ass. He can't talk. All these deaf jams, all these G EZ's, co-manager. Now this is all the racist usual suspects. Usual suspects. All the usual suspects. Some they want to bring more diversity, black music in the industry. It's all crap. You can't say nothing about it because. Tell about Justin Bieber's racist ass. Tell about the head's ass. Talk about all the time that Christina Aguiler was comes from Disney. Pretty Spears have done this too many goddamn times. But when you really look at this, all this, they have prop A. Madonna's prop A black culture. Oh, she might have a concaput songs that I do like. But when you really go back and listen to that again, you may want to see the issue here. She's prop A your culture. Prop A your culture. Symbolic. Totally. Symbolic. This is symbolism. They're really not solving the problem. How about we go in these? How about we build our own black industries? Then they can't be doing all this hustling. They can't be screwing us all. They can't be screwing us over with this crap. Who else? I'm gonna ratchet sign this crap. Yeah, all the rest of these people. John Legend. I don't expect that. That dirtbags, co-ass, all signs, something like that. He doesn't write with black people. Some men that's not the one who appropriates black culture. Oh, these guys, these guys are just. Oh, it's a lot of you folks always always always always trying to. Do Paul, not only appropriate black culture, it's always the usual suspects. Then they have depth metal. That was all created by Jewish records. Actually, share that depth metal is rolled in here so they can replace rock and roll. That's a fact. That's a complete fact. That's a fact that they all created a lot of that. So you better be ready. You go on and on. Marky Mark said racist shit. Oh, that's not a person we in top of. Marky. Yeah, all that's K-pop. All that. What does that all influence black culture? Come on. That's a group of Pink Floyd. That's not a group. Come on. Almost. A lot of these guys appropriate black culture. This is then fat and there's a lot of evidence that backs this shit up. Who is it? Oh, man. Boy. It's like, it's like they do this over and over and we always call it with these new sounds of music and they take it away. So like I said, it's a similar to that Drake's another suspect in this too. He's not a suspect. He's not on the blow black music action called Legend, but he's a suspect in this too. He's such a dead. So he's actually more suspect than anything. Because how they rolled up here and Cardi B. People want to talk about cash me outside girl. Well, she is one. She's definitely a culture. But I think they're going to have a hard time pushing cash me outside girl. I think the one you really have to worry about is Cardi B. You have to. I'm not a fan of Nick Minaj, though.

      "{'transcript': \" A Stu Studio D production. Kyle brought, okay, I just want to say, shot it again in the boulevard because Kyle bought this 12-pack of boulevard variety beers but they have a tasting room special and it's like a honey blonde ale. And it smells just like honey and it tastes delicious, it is so good anyway. If I, if I, Kyle bring me something to drink. Maybe. Boulevard is one of my favorite breweries and it's always been one of Matt's favorite breweries. So they first like started many, many years ago. I really love them anyway. And they would get you a tour with me. Yeah. I really loved their tour. We did it last summer when Kyle and I drove out for the reunion. We stopped in Kansas City and did the boulevard tour and it was, it was really, really fun. I think that new, new Belgium's tour was better as a tour goes. However, we went back before it was as big as it is now and I don't know if it's as good. Like I don't know if you can get to ride the slide anymore at New Belgium. Oh, yeah. You used to be able to. And it was so New Belgium number one and boulevard might be number two in terms of good tours. Yeah. I've done a lot of tours. We've drank a lot of beer in our lives. I mean, I mean, you know, Kyle and I have talked about it and there's no shortage of brewery tours to do here in numbers. But I will tell you most of the brewery tours in Denver are like, this is how you make beer. Here are the four ingredients you need to make beer. This is the that where this happens. And this is and it's like, all right, thanks. I know that because I've been to a million tours. Boulevard and New Belgium tell the story of their brewer. Yeah, there's so much history. Yeah. That's what's really interesting. I think it makes it a little more unique. Are we going to have a podcast? So our cold open will just be like, sit down. I want to tell you a story. Really weird. A messed up story with buttering ghosts and gobbledygools. It's all really fucked up. So don't you be fooled. It's a family story time. The podcast. Hello, everyone. Welcome to F.D.U. Family Storytime. Hannah has a mouthful of food. I just promised. I started. That's my goal. I'm honest. Hello, everyone. Welcome to F.D. Family Storytime. I'm Salem. And I'm Hannah. And with us today is everyone. Say hello, everyone. Hello, everyone. Hello, yeah, all Jess and Kelly. So we're doing hopefully our last episode remotely. It's been nice having everybody on the mic though. So I've been having tossing around the idea of figuring out how we could do that once we go back to recording in person. At least we've had this to get us through because it's been a kind of a wild ride. How's everyone doing? Good. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Everyone's kind of quiet today. You have graham crackers bell. Now I'm jealous. I do graham crackers. I was wanting graham crackers the other day for some reason. Because they're delicious. That's very good. Why is everyone have a snack? Everyone is eating everything right now. Hey, everyone make sure you get your loudest snacks because we're going. I'm eating a beet burrito. That is not loud at all. Oh, I can hear the smacking. Actually, I don't know if I can or not. I'm going to say I haven't even chewed yet. You can probably hear your jaw popping if we were quiet enough. You have to be that quiet. No. So we're here today recording our 18th episode. Our podcast is finally legal because it's a it can vote. It can't buy cigarettes anymore, but I can vote. That implies that it hasn't been legal these last 17 episodes, which is a little scary. What have we been doing? You can't buy cigarettes at 18 anymore. No, you have to be 21. When did that change? January. I thought that was just a proposal thing. Actually, when it happened, I'll snap. You can die for your country, but you can't buy alcohol or cigarettes. And that's pretty fucking stupid. Yeah, seems kind of hypocritical or something seems something bad like that. Like that's not the right word, but I'm like that. It's just it's not good. So before we get into our story filled with mayhem, we should probably go into our drink corner and see what everybody's drinking today. Okay, let's see how lame our quarantine. I blame my I'm proud of mine this time. I'm not drinking one, but I'm not drinking it right now because it's empty, but in my beautiful rainbow Starbucks cup, I made a smoothie, but with seltzer that I had because I have not gone to the liquor store in a while. But I had a smearing off fairy lemonade, like hard seltzer. I did a full bottle of that. Now I put strawberries and raspberries and then a mixed berry thing and I blended it all together and I put a little bit of tea in there because I put too many strawberries and it needed more liquid, but it was very good. That sounds delicious. What is it called? Just dragon smoothie. Just go with dragon smoothie. Okay, smooth dragon. Oh, I like that. Okay. He's a smooth flyer. What flyer? Oh, I get it. I'm low. I'm sorry. This is a smooth flyer. Smooth flyer. So who else has one? It's worth share. I have one. Okay. So I made the waky waky dragon. Oh, I like that. And this is all walk through how to make it is very difficult. It's a shot of espresso, except I run mine through my enough espresso machine twice. So it's kind of like a shot and a half. A splash of caramel syrup. The sounds of milk all over ice. And so it's basically just a nice spot. The waky waky dragon. I call it the waky waky dragon because that sounds way more fun. And now when I make it every morning before work, I'm going to call it the waky waky dragon. I like it. It's patent pending trademark or whatever we have to say. So nobody steals it. And then if you want it to be an alcoholic drink, you can add some kalua or some really disgusting coffee flavored whiskey that is in my cabinet right now. But I was a stream. You could put some ice cream. That could be good. Yeah. But I was afraid my whiskey would ruin the coffee because it's a really pretty gross tasting coffee flavored whiskey. So I didn't do it. The coffee would it be terrible? Yeah, I don't know. But I didn't want to ruin my delicious latte by finding out. I don't think there's anything that would make it not awful whiskey. Apparently being drunk when you're wearing it out at the distillery made it not awful because we bought like four freaking bottles. So that's the only thing that makes it taste not awful is being drunk and tasting it up at the distillery. All right, Kelly, why like your drink? Who wants to go next? I can go next unless don't want to go. I mean, I'm just drinking up in. Yeah. I ran out of I ran out of booze. I'm literally just drinking a the boulevard ginger lemon Radler. Oh, that sounds amazing. Yeah, I love boulevard. They're actually the only brewery that I've ever toured. Do you want to go Jess? I'm just drinking sparkling water with orange juice. It's a virgin mimosa's what I call it, but I'm drinking it out of a copper mug. So it makes it fancy. I have alcohol except for I have a couple beers in the fridge. That's all I had. And I didn't feel like going and getting any. What's it called? The Virgin Dragon. I don't know. Dragon monk dragon priest is the dragon priest. The Immaculate Dragon right? The Immaculate. The Dragon Mary. Mary dragon dragon Mary. And that again, we got a lot of names that it could be. What was the name of your spell? Lazy dragon. Lazy dragon. I mean, can I really coin it as a different name when it already is? It's just a beauty. She can name it. It doesn't change. The Dragon of Broken Dreams. Cale Green Day. Oh my god. Dragon of Broken Dreams. I love it. All right. So now, so I made also have a well, you didn't have a hot drink, did you Kelly? So I made a basically a tatty. It's Earl Grey tea with orange blossom honey and some lime juice because I was out of lemon juice and some and a shot of secrets. There you go. And it's called the, what did I come up with? I had it. It's it's the Earl of Dragon, whatever, something. The hot tatty Earl of Dragon. I mean something like that. What if it's just the dragon of Earl? The dragon of Earl like Duke of Earl, but it's a dragon dragon of Earl. The tatty dragon of Earl. A tawdry dragon of Earl. All right. So, are we ready to get into the story? Sure. Let's figure out or whatever it was you were doing. Yes. So, um, let's see. I got to get my my printer ran out of ink. And so I only have half my pages printed. So I'm gonna try to get the dates right. Sorry guys. There we go. I hate it when you print on both sides and you can't tell which one goes first. And you would think that the pages that are running out of ink would be the last ones, but they're not. They're the first ones. That's weird. Okay. All right. You know. Yeah. I really liked the idea of my counter height table when I got it, but it's been a year now. And it just makes me tired scooting my chair in when I sit at it. All right. You guys ready? Yes. So Norway. Okay. I'm trying to do this. Sorry. It's gonna be cheesy. Norway. Late 80s, early 90s, black metal. No. We're talking about that. Exactly right. We're gonna talk about the black metal scene in Norway. In the late 80s and in the early 90s, it was a pretty new black metal was new. There was death metal and there was, you know, you had metal, you had your death metal, it had punk, but this was different. They were trying to be something totally unique. So we're gonna start with the band mayhem. Have you guys heard of mayhem? Yes, she's over there because they're pretty popular name and the band is still around. Well, they got together in the 19 was it 1984, I think, is when they got together and it was just three guys. So the three founders of the group were Oistin Arseft and the Kaitel, Manheim, and Jorn Stubberud. Stubberud. I don't know. So the three of them started the band in 1984 and they, you know, wanted to kind of create this new genre, not death metal, not heavy metal, but like black metal, which was supposed to be the opposite of what everybody likes. Like, they wanted to fight against society by being completely opposite. So they didn't want to be appealing. They didn't want to be aesthetic to look at. They didn't want to be aesthetic to listen to. They wanted to be, you know, embrace that cold. Like a lot of them, it's kind of funny. They, in the interviews that I watched would talk about how Norway is like this cold and landscape, you know, dreary and dark and that seeps into the people of Norway so that it becomes a part of them. And that's kind of what their music embodied. So did you do that on purpose, Jess? I think it's hilarious. We want to be what nobody likes. So how are they going to make money and be popular? Well, they didn't care to make money or be popular. They didn't. So anyway, so these three guys, and they use like Satanism and kind of the, you know, black arts, that kind of stuff to get attention because it would shock people. And it was kind of like, so it kind of became an image for them. They never really in the beginning were interested in that kind of stuff. Like they didn't, and they never practiced Satanism, even though they were accused of it. But it was more just like an image to kind of get attention. So anyway, at one point they hired, they had like some singers that had come in. One was named Maniac, I think, and I can't remember what the other one's name was, over like the next couple years. And then in 1988, they got this singer whose name was Pella Olin, and he went by the name of Dad. So like they create, they all adopted, most of them adopted these names if they would go by. So like, Oystein, he was the guitarist, and he was kind of like, he viewed himself as the leader, whether other people viewed him as a leader is questionable. That was what he thought his role was. He went by Uranumus. So I'm going to use these names for these people because it's easier for me to remember. So Uranumus, and then the bass player who was the Jorn Stubmerud, he went by Necro Butcher. Yikes. He was the bassist. And then the original drummer, he, Kitele Mannheim, he didn't have, so I'm just going to call him Mannheim. But Dad was the singer then that they had gotten a few years later. And he was very, like everybody said when remembering him that he was very depressed, and he was like obsessed with death, and which is why he chose the name Dad. And he would wear corpse makeup, and he kind of presented himself as like the first person to wear corpse makeup when he was performing. And they even said that like, no, it wasn't like Kiss, because that was one of the things I said, because this is in the 80s, Kiss was in the 70s, and they already wore the white and black, you know, face paint, but they were like, no, it wasn't like Kiss, that was flashy. This was like white and black makeup that was really supposed to symbolize them being dead, make them look like they're dead, corpse makeup. So I didn't think it looked that different, honestly. So they could have, they could have been in. No, no, no, we're not like Kiss at all. No, you're not wearing more. Maybe we'll put some pictures on our page and let me know. We were the first. Yeah, I mean, kids are okay. And there are some there are some pictures that kind of show how dark they were, but, but yeah, the face paint though, I still think, I mean, it wasn't a star like didn't one guy and kids have like a black star over his eye and stuff, it wasn't that flamboyant, but it was still black and white face paint around the eyes, angular patterns on the nose and it looks like like skeleton maybe. Maybe yeah, I'm trying to be wrong about saying this. It reminded me of Brandon Lee from the crow. Yeah, kind of like that. But I had to Google and make sure that that was actually a thing that I didn't just make up in my head, but he actually worked a thing in that movie. Yeah, so, so this guy dead though, he was really, he was depressed and he was obsessed with death, but he was just very bizarre about it. He would find dead animals and he would save them to be close to death. He would put like dead things in a bag like a dead crow and a paper bag and so he could smell it before he would go, you know, so he could experience the death. It was very bizarre and or gross or gross. Yeah, and I guess there's this story that when he was young like 11 years old that he was in an accident, he almost died or he did die for a few minutes and he saw the light never since then he had been obsessed with death and he was very suicidal and he talked about killing himself. I guess he attempted to kill himself several times and one of the things I've got a quote here somebody, this is a from a member of a cultist which is another cultopus, black metal band, a cultist, a cultist, yeah, a cultopus. No, a cultopus is the black art shop in one of the episodes of psych, sorry. Okay, but he says about dead that he didn't see himself as human. He saw himself as a creature from another world. He said he had many visions that his blood has frozen in his veins and that he was dead. That is the reason he took that name. He knew he would die. So that just kind of gives you a feel for his image. He even would like bury his clothes for three or four days before a show so he would dig them up and wear them and they would look like he had been buried in them like a corpse. He when he became the singer he was very dark and he kind of brought this darkness into the band like they were already saying they were Satanists and trying to be but it was more like an image. They weren't good people none of them were fucking good people because I watched a couple documentaries and that movie Lords of Chaos with McCauley Caulkin which it they're not McCauley Caulkin Rory Caulkin. Yeah Rory Caulkin. Rory McCaulkin is that what you always said? Did you guys watch Waco? He's in that. Did you guys watch Waco on Netflix? Because he's in that and it's good. It also has the girl that plays Ruth in Ozark and she's really good too but it's about Waco which is cool not cool but it's interesting. It's not related to what we're talking about. No but you mentioned I'm very Caulkin and I was excited because we started watching Waco. Okay I'm sorry. So anyway so in all of those the the Lords of Chaos from what some of the people that were involved in the Black Metal scenes say that it took liberties it wasn't accurate but none of them portrayed these people as like good people so they were all kind of shitty people. But anyway so when dad joined the band he kind of brought this darkness and amped this darkness and there's like accounts of Uranus the guitarist he would like egg on dead and stuff with the suicide like egg on like do it go ahead and do it if you're going to do it you know and like do it do it do it do it and do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it but he you know and people commented that it was just odd that they would see him with this kind of behavior like really encouraging him encouraging dead to you know pursue that that thinking and then one really creepy thing that dead did and this is they were just fucking weird like when they so they didn't have a lot of concerts in the beginning but when they started to have concerts like and it was about the time dead joined the group they would like put pigs heads on a stake you know on front of the stage and stuff and he when dead would sing he would like take a knife or broken glass and cut himself and he would like cut himself so bad that he would spray blood onto the audience and the audience would just eat that shit up because it was fucking weird yeah and he had a lot of like kind of satanic symbolism but I don't think he was satanic he was just dark you know death obsessed with death so anyway it just kind of brought this whole new and I think at some point in here is when manheim the original drummer left and they got a new drummer his name was hellhammer I think I think I like how the original drummer was like I don't have a funny name and then they go replace him and they're like we got to get someone who will have a name well and it was it was funny because I watched one documentary that really talked to the original drummer a lot even though he wasn't involved in the band when like the crazy shit goes down he was still a part of the scene and like friends with uronomus and stuff but he kind of even like comments he's like I was in other bands I think he just got the fuck out of there like this shit's getting weird and I got other bands that I can be in and I don't need to yeah like he talks about how uronomus really lived in a fantasy world he gets to a point where like he's he's in a fantasy world with this whole image and scene that he creates you know so I was trying to find the drummer's actual name I'm sure it's here somewhere and I just can't read it anyway hellhammer I'm pretty sure was his name but anyway so they got him and he seemed to be a little bit more okay with like the dark ass like book shit and just and just kind of went along with it and um there's a character a character there's a one of one of the guys he's in a different band he he kind of joins me him later his name is barg vicarnees vicarness and he goes by count grishnack um so the count it's this is just the count on him later but I'm just bringing him up now because I watched one interview with him where he talks about how dead he had called him and asked him for some ammunition for a shotgun and he was like yeah that's cool and he ran it over to him gave it to him and then he shot himself with it so dead it killed himself he actually slipped both of his wrists arm you know arms from like wrist to elbow slit his neck and then shot himself in the head with a shotgun um low heel like I'm one of those things alone will kill you like I'm really impressed that after being cut on both arms and in the neck he was able to shoot himself but he was used to that he would do that shit on stage he would cut his arms he would make huge cuts on his arms and on his neck and stuff granted these were deeper cuts I think probably but he was probably used to losing blood and like that you know but anyway yeah he did all of that supposedly maybe it wasn't maybe it wasn't a suicide but he was very vital and uh but he so they had a house where they lived and and they jammed and shit the band did and so but he was there alone dead was there alone when he killed himself and when uronomists came back he had actually breaking through a window to get into the house because he didn't have a key and he expected people to be there expected dead to be there and when he broke in he found dead dead and uh with his brains blown out on the bed um it's kind of foreshadowing his choice of names well and that's what everybody said like his choice of names and the way he was it was obvious that he was gonna kill himself he had tried before like nobody was surprised that he killed himself it's sad he's gotten some help but but people didn't do that in the late 80s early 90s well and in in Norway I think there was maybe even been less of that kind of yeah I don't know anything about Norway so when I was watching the documentaries they just seem like maybe like a little bit older time you know that maybe I don't know a lot I'm just making assumptions because I'm watching two documentaries you know more than we do um that's the entirety of our podcast making assumptions made us like one book we read or pretty much but anyway so when uronomists climbed in the window and he found dead he instead of calling the cops immediately he ran to the store and got a camera and came back and he actually moved items and staged them and took pictures of the host and then and he took the pictures he also took pieces of his skull and he made them into the and he would pass them out to the inner circle of the black metal movement as in and tell people what they were when he called the rest of the band to let him know that dead he killed himself he says dead has done something really cool he killed himself and necro butcher said you know he thought have you lost it what do you mean cool and then uronomists said relax I have photos of everything he did come out with another album and the album cover was the picture of dead you I wondered I wondered when he was taking the pictures if he was like I'm gonna be able to use these to spread our you grossed it actually used the picture on a photo album or photo album on an album cover probably had a photo album too it's in his scrapbook and his scrapbook so I wouldn't be surprised but he took those pictures and necro butcher was really pissed at him for having those pictures and he basically told him until you get rid of those pictures don't call me and he quit the band and he left because he was pretty disgusted by him despite necro butcher's name right not have been as much of a total douche's no he actually he he just want more like more decent see and the thing is that like the original drummer manheim and necro butcher and uronomist they all formed this band in 84 when they were like just kids like high school kids like I got the impression that they like went to school together and stuff and they would talk about how they knew uronomists to be like this straight a student good kid you know hang out with his parents they would like stay they would jam at his parents house and he would goof with his little sister and shit you know and so he kind of takes this weird dark turn as the band takes his dark turn which really kind of starts with dead you know because they're all soaking up the image they're all like yeah we're Satan is you know that's what we stand for because they're trying to be hated they're trying to be like this that's like what they stand for is to be like what everybody hates which is weird so weird get it because it's a rebellious thing it's rebelling against authority and there was a general I got to say there was a general like white supremacist nihilistic kind of view that was permeated the whole scene so maybe they were fueled by that too but but anyway necro butcher got pissed about the pictures and he quit the band he thought uronomists had gone too far and so that's when they brought in I think that's when they brought in varg he's the count but his his stage name is count Grishnack. Grishnack. I like varg better. Sounds vargan. I let's have what varg meant and in old Norse it means thief. Oh oh so does it mean dragon? The language is Norse not Norwegian. What is that old Norse? Yeah I don't know about currently I don't know. I have information. I have information that Norwegian is the language spoken in Norway which is obvious but I started doubting myself and it is closely related to Swedish and Danish which are all linguistic descendants of old Norse. The Norse is a language but it is not the like he and it's not the current language. It's like the Viking language when that was all just one big area and it didn't have separate countries yet. Yes okay I just dropped some knowledge. So where did I leave off? Varg had just joined the band at some point he joins the band. I don't hang out. I don't know. He's like you know it's not a burping head. And he plays with them for a little while. But he also so in the midst of all of this I think it's after Deb dies Uranimus opens up a record store. So he has his own record label and he wants to produce black metal music on his record label and he has a record store but the record store isn't really profitable it's more just like a hangout. He lives there for a while and he has there's other people that like he has a kid this kid that goes by the Bard Faust. The Bard Faust. And he's like 16 years old goes to Oslo because this is all in Oslo, Norway goes to Oslo and gets a job at the record store ends up like living there. He stays behind the counter and Uranimus has a place that he stays and then you go down in the basement of this place and there's like a big hangout area and it kind of attracts all of these people and they create this like dark circle like a black like inner circle of black metal and they kind of perpetuate this idea of like darkness and Satanism. But again it's a lot of the time it's just an image. A lot of people report Uranimus as being somebody who was just talked and really not not serious. He would make a lot of you know make a lot of comments and statements and stuff but he wasn't a follow-through kind of guy you know what I mean? So yeah and so at this point when he has the record stores when he starts working with Varg and Varg also produces his own album he he's uh I think he's like a one-man band but it's um Bursum is what it was. Bursum was his band and he says when he recorded that that because he wanted to be like the antithesis of everything that people like he wanted the sound to be as shitty as possible so he told them when they went into the studio like I want the shittiest drums I want the shittiest like no you don't need to tune that guitar and he wanted the shittiest mic to sing into so they ended up using headphones because that's the shittiest mic that they could come up with and so just like that weird concept but uh this guy Varg was really almost like Aryan in the way that he thought he was a Nazi supporter he you know liked Hitler he was very pure he was a purist like he didn't drink he didn't do drugs he didn't smoke he didn't take medicine over the counter medicine pharmaceuticals he was a vegetarian like Hitler you know he was very you know that kind of mentality which was in the scene but he was a bit extreme so they're doing their thing hanging out this kid I told you the bard Faust he was uh at one point he went to Lily Hammer and he was a weirdo and a lot of people were reported that he had like this obsession with serial killers and like kind of seemed like he had this obsession with wanting to know what it was like to kill somebody so anyway he goes to Lily Hammer he goes to a bar when he's leaving after a couple of drinks he's walking away this 30-something year old man comes up and propositions him and he acts like he's interested Faust acts like he's interested and kind of like lures him into the woods and then kills him and he stabs him and he comes goes back to Oslo the next day and he tells everybody is like I killed a man last night and he tells him and your onomist sees it this is my impression anyway because it's hard to know what he was really thinking but um I think he saw it as an opportunity to gain some gain some notoriety for him you know so he supports him he's like good job and he tells people but he's like you can't you know tells people in the inner circle you know but he's like you can't spread this this stays just with us but um you know he like pumps him up and this kid Faust ends up becoming like this you know he has like the status or this prestige because it's like they're all trying to be like darker than the next person like you've seen shit like that like and even though it's not punk music it really makes me think of like because I hung out with some punks when I was never punk but I hung out with some punks you know when I lived in that house when Bell was a kid and they liken themselves to hard punks you know what I mean living the hard life and they had lived on the street some of these people so these people were fucking like I was probably a shitty mom for letting them anywhere near Bell but um and they weren't like evil Satanist or anything like that they didn't kill people but there was like this pissing contest of who's who's the punkest you know of us all who who's the hardest in the realest you know and I'm real and are you real and that kind of stupid bullshit and I kind of liken it to that only in this black metal like who's the darkest who's the you know what I mean who's the most fucked up evilest son of a bitch you know so Faust became like this was you know kid that had a lot of status but then you don't really hear much about him for a while in the whole sequence of things um and then shortly after that or right about the same time the Faust is in Lillie Hammer and murders this guy is when the first church burns down and now breaks so Kelly can pee what do you have a question did you mention church is burning down before or was this a big reveal like it feels like or did I not hear something no I haven't mentioned anything oh okay I'm lighting it up she said I waited for her to finish everything so she could cut this out but I was like did I stop? uh an necklace of a human skull that wasn't for my friend who committed suicide that's the thing it's like the circumstances of it right yeah well and there there was a closeness between your onomice and dead it was a weird twisted relationship oh bully bully herbally relationship weird it's still fucked up so I just have to say that this episode is reminding me of a stupid episode of bones where there's this black metal band who killed someone and they cut themselves on stage and I'm like oh this is the real band that they stole that story from and it might be in the other um like black metal death metal bands that do weird shit like this but they were like really like dead with really hardcore about it the way he did it so yeah oh my god the name of the episode is even called mayhem on a cross sorry so it's funny because it's about it's actually about a murder they find this like murdered body a nor they a Norwegian black metal band has a human skull hanging up and authorities come in and determine it's a real human or human skeleton not just a skull and so of course bones being the foremost spiritual world they send it to her and they trace it back to an American black metal band with a guy who cuts himself and all this stuff so I bet it was based on him let's go ahead Salem so where did we leave off we left off with a church catching on fire I think yeah oh there was a rash of churches burning down at this point in time it started on June 6th of 1992 and there is the it was the sixth day of the sixth month and there was another six there at six o'clock I think was one of the references that was made and to when the fire was was uh started and it burnt the church to the ground and then there were several more attacks over the next year there's at least seven other churches including one that was burnt down on Christmas Eve so nobody really claimed that they did it nobody owned up to it there is definitely it was somebody in that inner black metal circle is what the thinking is and um but that could have been the black metal circle is multiple bands it's not just mayhem yeah some of the names of the bands if you're interested there's the buzz bursum and then there's dark throne and uh mayhem I can't remember all the others but anyway what do we think bursum means I don't know it's interest like b-u-r-z-u-m bursum I don't know but um so during this time I personally think that it was a combination of people I think that um uronomus was probably involved in some of the people have said that he was involved that he had been there for some of them but that he wasn't necessarily the one that threw the match a lot of people viewed him like uronomus thought that he was the leader it was his record store it was where everybody hung out and he was supposedly in charge of all of these um guys telling him what to do but he was all talk and not a lot of action is what a lot of guys said about him in the documentaries I watched so he you know might have been involved but he wasn't the the one I think personally that it was barge and he's the one actually who got convicted for um the arson but I don't think it was just him either so at one point varg decides that he wants to go to the media and he wants to let them know because they don't really have an idea at that point who's burning the churches because this kind of shit doesn't happen in Norway like they're pretty quiet community you know with not a lot of crime and stuff so they're thinking like terrorism and stuff at first but varg decides he wants to go to the media he talks to a journalist he's a fucking idiot he was a total fucking idiot because he like lets him take pictures of him he like gives them all of this information says that he's not the one who did it but he knows the people and it's this group that he's with and he's trying to get publicity for their music but the journalist ends up going immediately to the police the police start an investigation your onomist gets pissed at him because like what the fuck are you doing um there's some people that say your onomist was in on it but a lot of people will say that he was mad for bringing all of this attention to them because then there was investigations against the group the record shop I think ended up shutting down he moved out of the record shop I mean it changed a lot of stuff and so there was this like contentiousness between varg and your onomist and varg was pissed off because your onomist had produced hit varg's record on his label and he had used the money that he was supposed to give back to varg to put in the mayhem and recording mayhem and shit like that so he felt at least that's what the movie said I don't know how true that is but he felt I know the truth is that he felt slighted by him so there was some sort of a contract the movie portrays it as a contract where your onomist sets it up as saying here I sign over all the rights to your music you can go do what you want with it and I will pay back the money that I owe you and we'll just be done I'm not sure if that's what the real contract showed or not but there was a contract and there had been this rumor going around that your onomist had said he was going to kill varg because he was tired of the noise that he was making and then he was gonna stun him with a taser and then torture him and do it all on film and make us not film out of it and I don't know if there was any truth to that or not but with everybody in the way they portrayed your onomist as being like all talk it's hard for me to believe even if he said it I bet you he didn't mean it you know what I mean like he wasn't really gonna go kill Varg but anyway Varg shows up at his house one night with the contract saying that he had signed it and he kills him and Varg says that he did it in self-defense that your onomist attacked him and he'd heard that your onomist was gonna kill him so he was just defending himself but he stabs him like 23 times and the majority of them I believe are in the back and there's self-defense no and there's evidence that your onomist was trying to escape so he was in the apartment and he'd gotten like locked in the apartment and he'd gotten himself out of the apartment was running down the stairs of this apartment complex as Varg chased him and was stabbing him and so even though Varg he stands by self-defense because he says if I hadn't killed him he was planning on killing me and he would have killed me so I had to kill him to save my life wait wait wait wait so pre-empt I was self-defense so I had to chase him and stab him in the back because if he would have let him live he would have come back and killed him later so his preemptive self the yes yeah I don't know if that would hold up in a court of law I don't think it would yeah this pre-meditative self-defense so yeah so the last stab that he did the last time they stabbed him was like a stab wound to the head that's pretty freaking severe yeah that's my first oh i don't think i'm like that oh no it's pretty i told George when i was on break i said i'll be happy to get this story out of my head because it's pretty dark and i've watched and all of this shit that i've watched like the movie was really graphic and the documentary had some live footage of of this one artist performing that i don't even know who he was because i've kind of fallen asleep a little bit and then woke up and then got it was performing we're great at research guys we're great at research but he was doing this performance artwork he started off there was like all these posters hanging on this brick wall he's like in an alley and there's all these people standing around and they have like these satanic symbols or like arcane symbols written on them and he's like breathing fire at these posters and lighting them on fire and burning them and then he sits down at the end and like slits his wrist like from wrist to elbow like both arms and then his neck like he was imitating dead suicide and then just lays on this couch there and bleeds everyone's like standing around like is the show over like do we go like what it was just like fucking weird i know like that's the kind of shit i've been watching the last few days so all right so back to me um no back to mayhem so sorry so at this point you would think mayhem would be over your honest is dead and he's killed by varg apparently the police were already looking at varg for the arsons and they had tapped his phone and they heard him talking to somebody about how he was going to kill uronomus and the thought is that they just let him do it figuring they catch him and then it would get rid of another dirt bag you know that was because they thought uronomus was involved too right i don't know that's just let him take some of the people say that have been interviewed i'm not arguing the logic it just i mean like something that would fly here no save some money for their jail system or whatever and their court system i guess it also was the 90s right yeah yeah this is the early 90s like 93 um so either way regardless they catch him they pretty much immediately after he kills uronomus and he gets sentenced to the maximum he pleads self-defense which they're like yeah why the fuck ever that's bullshit and uh they sent him to the maximum that you can get in Norway which is 21 years what so i know what's like the mikkeland what's the murder rate in Norway i don't know it must not be that bad the maximum sentence for like first degree murder is 21 years stop it bad kitty i'm sorry i meant to me i should have muted myself before i did that my paltz he was eating people food he's such an asshole in the process of him going through his trial and everything somehow he it comes out that the barred fouse had killed that guy in lily hammer and so he also gets charged and convicted with that murder and sentenced to 21 years so both of them are out now this was in 93 94 maybe they were sentenced to 95 i don't know how long trials take but still either way they're out now living their lives after all this weird crazy shit why hannah i found out the murder rate in norway when it's very low it's 0.53 per 100 000 population and in 2018 there were only 25 murders in all of norway wow well i guess we can't go judging their criminal justice system i don't have the need for a better criminal justice justice than i have i don't know but so um so that's pretty much the story of mayhem and the black metal movement some people still attribute uronomus and mayhem especially with the beginning of the movement because they they were the first to kind of pull away although to me and this is just my untrained musical ear and black metal i guess but um they all like death metal black metal they all sound the fucking same so but apparently they were like the forefathers of the whole movement and stuff and mayhem still exists they still tour they still record necro butcher actually came back after uronomus had died and reformed the band and there's been changes i think hel hammer might still be with him too but i i don't i'm not sure about that but they have very clearly stated that they are not Satanists they have never been Satanists they've never done rituals or black magic or any of that kind of shit and that it was all just an image and that they didn't support any of the weird shit that happened so that's the story of mayhem and of black metal and where it went totally fucking south i mean terrifying i don't have any more huh like i guess for me it's kind of like i want to create something that everybody hates and is the antithesis of good things like really where did they think it was going to end up like how do they think it was going to turn out well and the new the new mayhem still embodies that kind of idealism to a certain extent like they don't want to be mainstream they don't want to be what everybody likes they're rebelling against a lot of ideas and if anything they probably still have i'm not sure but it sure seems like they still have a bit of that kind of what's the term i'm looking for then kind of uh not not nazi but you know that arian kind of white supremacist yeah and not just that just like the purism you know like it's so you're saying are you looking for the word racism because like i don't know not a lot of respect for human life kind of in there they scream their members better and they ask them like so we just want to make sure that this is just an act for you right like this isn't really how yeah feel you're not really a murderer or crazy person this you're just a good actor right like we want to make sure it does raise the question of like where is the line like how do you get the crazy people who are like yeah this is my way of life but not really my way of life it's all just pretend but it's not because it feels i think that when you start burning down churches and shit that maybe you're a bit too extreme and you shouldn't be in the band anymore like there's like it's just like a really great actor can portray a really horrible person and it doesn't mean they're that person like fans are performers kiss kiss wasn't they didn't walk around and make up all the time like it was a persona they performed you know i'm not going to say that any of these guys are good people i started off saying that too like and i don't know enough about them but i think they're all to a certain extent kind of assholes you know what i mean dickheads bad people doesn't mean learner it's not all an act like they don't want to be mainstream they want to be in this like culture so it can't 100% enact it's more just you can't take it too far exactly all right well that worry isn't that yeah good job it's interesting thank you it's very different than anything we've heard so far and i thank you george he's the one who drew my attention to it told me that i should do it that does seem like what george would like like that sort of stuff like it it's good no because he was not a Satanist or anything he really likes the opposite literary music so he probably just watched this documentary on the music and was like wow that's a fucked up story sammam should tell that on her i like that though hannah that is correct he is quite the opposite uh a Satanist you okay kelly me i just got a little stroke i'm all right so do we have things that don't suck oh god i said don't suck things that don't suck i guess i have a big one okay i have two okay can i go yeah okay my first is we'll come back to you for your second it's only fair that's fine okay i'm just kidding kelly my first one was the one i was planning to talk about and then the second one came up this morning and made me all all sappy and and so i thought i'd share it so the first one is that we are really close to being able to go back to camping in the state like technically we can but all the state parks are like kind of like there's different openings and so matt and i have a reservation next weekend for my birthday on saturday and we are hopefully going to be able to go it's all up in the air because the the campground hasn't like announced that they're officially open but they can open and then if they open they might like only be at 50 percent capacity but my thing that doesn't suck if camping okay camping is just amazing being outside campfire stars and i'm going to get to do it again someday so that's the one i like the whole outside campfire stars but then when i'm sleepy i want to go back inside so we have upgraded our camping gear because we're so excited because we all of our trips were canceled so we were like what can we do that we're allowed to do in our state so we've upgraded all our camping gear and if we can go next weekend we now have a much thicker mushy memory foam mattress thing that we're going to sleep on we have a new tent that has this little screened-in porch area so if the mosquitoes are bad you can set chairs in the screen in porch area to get out of the mosquitoes and i have been researching like food like camping food so that we can like up our no more like hot dogs on a stick we're going to make like full meals and like aluminum foil packets and like breakfast so i'm not even like to do that at home why would i want to do that outside well yeah most of the emergency to have that anyway that's good for you Kelly though it's good for you though because you love that stuff and so i'm very excited and excited if our reservation gets canceled next weekend you can find us in our backyard on saturday night camping okay um what you're saying should i do my other one or am i supposed to wait till it comes back around not dear other one so my other one is so the back story is this morning i saw Matt's cousin one of his cousins just had a baby and that cousin's sister posted this morning um and she's like my age she's like 35ish and she posted this morning about how she gets to hold her nephew for the first time and she's so in love and she never knew she could love another human being as much and she was so excited to be an aunt and i was like i've been an aunt since i was eight years old and so and sometimes it can be like and whatever no big deal but the reality is is very sweet that she posted that and i feel very fortunate that i am able to be an aunt to amazing nieces and nephews and i love them more than i could ever love a human being just like she said and i just thought that i should share that with you all who wants to go next who has something that doesn't suck hmm uh i'll go i mean i guess something that doesn't suck is we had some my work has been doing these optional meetings for for load employees they have to be optional because they're not paying us um just updates and we're still on track to come back on time so it doesn't look like our flow is going to be extended or anything past and i need a day so so i can't decide if i'm happy or not i'm hoping by july i'll be tired of being at home but i haven't really wanted to go back to work yet necessarily other than the fact of you know making money and not starving and losing the house minor details yeah i've been enjoying being at home i haven't hit that okay i've run out of things to entertain myself with yeah i'm working full time and i feel i've had other things i'm ready to go back i mean i've been redoing my bathroom though and had a lot of projects to work on so that's true and an annoying kid to take care of that is true well i have things that's all suck and it's kyle kyle's making that doesn't suck because he today especially but always it's just so supportive and so loving and i can't wait to marry him and yeah i mean he didn't have to kill us or i made you do you gotta be secure any toward me a beer you didn't make me cry it's just like i mean i did if i haven't said no you didn't make me cry it's just that you sparked the pressure that i have been under hey i've made a lot of people cry it's okay bell you can just say it it won't hurt me like okay no i love it bell i love it because what's the excuse no because if you made me cry i would have been like yeah you made me cry but it was just that you reminded me just like how much shit i have to get done like just out of both this what i'm here for i guess i don't all my bullshit about shit that's okay crying is okay i'm never gonna will ask people just like oh i love a good cry like no it's true that's it but no i do sometimes enjoy it i mean if i feel like i need it all make us me watch a sad movie to like spark it like if i feel like i like need a good cry like i will watch something super sick and then i feel like i need a good cry i never always just cried well that was a good thing though yeah kyle is a thing that doesn't suck he would suck for kyle but suck even less if he brought me alcohol just kidding do you have something hannah i'm so tired that's not a thing that doesn't suck that's a thing that sucks but my thing that doesn't suck is this tv show on hulu called the great it's really good and i'm really enjoying it and i talked to mom about it all night last night so she's tired of me saying it but what's it called the great it's about the path from the great okay it looks really good it's fantastic i've seen that one yet and i love it and it's making me happy to watch it all i haven't been on hulu forever i've been binge watching a court tv shows that sounds fun all right well my thing that doesn't suck is that the renaissance festival isn't cancelled it's just postponed are they gonna have x's so you socially distance are we gonna have to wear masks probably i think we'll have to wear masks but i think like the research is showing that outside is pretty okay so i think it's gonna happen i think we're gonna get it it's in august and september so that's still a ways away it's hot enough man and my mask doesn't match my outfit no one that matches your outfit is there any mask that matches your outfit wait seal them what i'm gonna get one of those you know with the long nose like the doctor used to wear then you put the doctor you know they're called the bird like they're called plague masks plague masks yes that's what we should all wear some plag masks yes but they don't cover your face right i don't think they perform the same function i i can put in filters or something we'll make it work it'll be great it's gonna be so good but it is to go to renfest in june in july imagine what it's gonna be like in august in september well september won't be that bad august will be august will be hot well then let's go in september let's go on my birthday it won't be open yet let's not can that be a lot of my new belvis comei hot i love you but i don't love you that much but it's good that they're coming back because a lot of those shops those are businesses that rely on being able to tour and do um and do the the festival circuit so to speak you know yeah yeah well i love you guys are we done are you seeing dan i think we're done all right love you guys love you bye love you bye\", 'rssUrl':

      "{'transcript': ' [Music] Hi Elizabeth! Hi Flush! And welcome to Fan Splaining, the podcast by For and About fandom! This is episode number 128, the K-pop narratives. There are so many narratives, so many. Very, very quick summary. So this is the, we haven\\'t had a new episode in a month because we pause the podcast in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests two weeks ago. Over the course of the last month, there\\'s been a lot of mainstream media attention around the actions of K-pop fans who have been doing things like flooding racist hashtags with fancams or crashing police scanner apps or most notably yesterday reserving, it wasn\\'t just them, but reserving hundreds of thousands of tickets to a Trump rally, thus leading to an incredibly embarrassing actual turnout. Right. And we have noticed that a lot of people who are writing articles about this don\\'t know what they\\'re talking about in a variety of ways. Samples include things like, \"Will the K-pop teen save us?\" K-pop fans should just become president. These are actual statements I\\'m reading right now. Yeah, I mean, they\\'re humorous overstatement, but even in humorous overstatement, it\\'s possible that\\'s a lot. So, but when it\\'s coming from a political pundit with 100,000 followers, humorous overstatement, that\\'s like out the window, right? Like, that\\'s, this is the people who do serious political commentary and they\\'re honestly saying things like, \"Alright, anyway, anyway, I\\'m not going to get into it yet, not yet.\" Right, because we have interviewed somebody who actually does know what they\\'re talking about with this way more than either one of us does. Or all the people were mentioning, but yes, in particular us as well. So, Kiej or Chaney, repeat guest, one of our favorite guests in the past. She came on last year to talk about stand culture more broadly and she also wrote a piece for us called The Empowered Stand, which was less about external perceptions of stand culture and more about internal dynamics around critique of your favorite artist and how that intersects with capitalism and the desire to be a good fan, which is like an endlessly interesting topic. She is an expert and she, there\\'s no one that I think either of us would rather talk to in this moment, so we were thrilled when she was available to come on. Yeah, and the one thing that we should note is that we recorded this interview with her before the Trump Tulsa rally, so the interview is going to touch on lots and lots of the stuff that\\'s been going on, but not that. And we\\'ll talk a little bit about that afterwards because, you know, now the story has developed. Developed is a strong word. The story is continued. Right, fair enough. Alright. Alright, should we, should we go roll the interview? Let\\'s do it. [Music] Alright, it\\'s time to welcome Kijra to the podcast. Welcome back, Kijra. Hi. Thanks for having me back. We are so excited that you\\'ve come back. We were counting. It\\'s been like a year, I want to say, counting down the last 365-ish days for you to return, so no, seriously. It was one of our favorite conversations last year. So like, you know, just saying. Yeah, it\\'s great to be here. Sorry about the circumstances of you coming back, but we\\'re happy to see. Yes, so there\\'s a few things going on top level bullets. I feel like I\\'ve been Google Docs a lot recently. K-pop stands mobilizing to flood racist hashtags and to jam up police surveillance tools and to do other kind of mass digital actions around the Black Lives Matter protests, to mainstream media learning about K-pop and being surprised. What is it? What are these people? Where did they come from? And perpetuating a narrative that K-pop fans are a certain type of fan, specifically like young white women who previously had never heard of politics. And three, the media, and I would say broader fandom spaces, two, being pretty bad about acknowledging the anti-Blackness that has long been endemic in K-pop spaces and has not abated in the last few weeks. Do you think those are the three top three? Yeah, yeah, I think that\\'s a great, like, bullet point description of what\\'s been happening. And there have been specific things that have happened that have sparked a lot of conversation to be fighting harassment within all of this, but that\\'s a top level description of everything. I think it all really started with the Dallas Police Surveillance app. I think that was when I first started seeing that mass action really start to happen. At least when-- Right, and what happened there is, right, people started sending in. It was like a snitching app where the Dallas police were asking people to send in, like, images of people doing bad things and bad things. Yeah, and team fan. Bad thing, you know. And yeah. Is it-- I was wondering, how did we get from anti-fascist to antifa? Isn\\'t that a weird, like, intonation, anyway, whatever? It\\'s antifa, though. Like, it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s-- Antifa, right? It should be anyway. Thank you. I\\'m glad that I\\'m not the only one who every time I hear antifa think, oh, are there antifascists? Right. Anyway. I\\'m sorry. Hold on. Some people pronounce the word \"antifa\" and some people pronounce it \"antifa.\" There\\'s two different ways to pronounce it. Antifa. But I understand antifa. I just understand antifa. No one says antifa. And yeah. The team. Kind of a cheerful way to say it. All right. All right. All right. So fan, anyway, they flooded the antifa snitching app with fancams, which suddenly everybody had in the mainstream media had to learn what a fan cam was. Yeah. Which was a big stat for a lot of people, right? Yeah. And I think when the police app, when the Dallas app basically had to shut down, they were just going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then they were going to get out of the way. And then seeing the same thing with I stand by not really to Black Lives Matter, but I stand by JK Rowling. And that was alarming because you saw 20,000 people had said that. And frankly, that one, I was like, oh my God, people are really just falling in line for her. Like no matter what she spews, like that fandom sucks. And then I clicked on it. And it was like, you know, three people. But it also doesn\\'t matter. But it also doesn\\'t matter if whatever it is. Because when you look at how people talk about it, that still gives Fox News the headline. That this thing is trending. And that\\'s positive. They can still say that officially. And that reaches even more people than the actual trending thing is going to reach. Right. And if they\\'re not looking at the context of it, I would just say, myself and for a few Black fans, just seeing that in your timeline anyway, regardless of whether it\\'s a fan cam and it\\'s anti the hashtag. It\\'s trying to hashtag. You don\\'t want to see white lives matter. I\\'m sure. Like it\\'s alarming. It\\'s not right. It makes you feel unsafe. It makes you feel unwelcome. And I think, yeah, it\\'s kind of counter productive overall, even though I think it was done with the intent of countering that. And kind of, you know, taking the power away from it. I don\\'t know if that particular approach, I think it just gave your life in the country to the house. I\\'m in character than people\\'s feeds and people\\'s minds. A lot of people think it probably did. Yeah. It was interesting to to look at the way that was working on Twitter side by side with the Black squares on Instagram. And there was a lot of commentary. People who missed missed that one. I don\\'t know how who started the you should put a black square up. Yeah, that\\'s it. I honestly don\\'t know. I think it was it\\'s like a like many of viral ideas to just take off for some reason. It sounded good in theory to somebody, but that\\'s another situation that really was counterproductive because the Black Lives Matter hashtag is actually used by activists and we\\'re in the movement to share useful information. And it was being clogged up with black squares and, you know, no actual useful information. So it was actually doing harm for information. Because it was just basically filling it with no information, useless information, especially in the midst of the protests, like this was a time where the hashtag was important to be cleaned up for information to be shared. And it was doing the opposite of that just by having black squares and a few vague comments about black lives or whatever. Right. Right. So it actually seemed like inadvertently that did the work that flooding a hashtag, you know, if you\\'re antagonistic towards a topic, that that actually caused real harm because it made it difficult for people to share information. Whereas a lot of the stuff I was seeing from kpop on Twitter was amplifying stuff that people weren\\'t trying to like, you know, people aren\\'t using Twitter trending topics to organize information that let\\'s not have a communication means, you know, and so to watch a, you know, racist hashtag or transfer the cash tag, go from 5000 to 50000 in a matter of hours. It\\'s like, you\\'re not blocking anyone\\'s discourse here. All you\\'re doing is just creating more volume. Exactly. But I think that\\'s, you know, one of the things that kpop fandoms really good at is creating volume. Yeah, like that. It\\'s one of the things that it\\'s a source of power. I think I said that in the last talk I had with y\\'all is that that being able to train quickly being able to mobilize quickly being able to like shoot a hashtag up to the top of trending and that\\'s quickly is a source of power that a lot of pop music stands in kpop music stands in particular really value of time they show like, hey, we\\'re, we\\'re out here, we are Legion, we have power and I think that that was a response that made sense. I think to fans is to say this is something we can do right and not necessarily thinking through what it really means and to what end with the purpose it serves, but it\\'s something that can be done quickly. Right. It seems kind of, yeah, it seems kind of perverse that it would be the negative side of things and not the positive side when you think about the way that trending hashtags could help potentially right like if you get black lives matter trending even higher than it already was if you went into, you know, you\\'re just a or something like that that\\'s not necessarily trending at all times and making that trend could have been really powerful. But then I think about like going for something positive like that kind of requires that you have content to your speech that they sound really rude to say but it\\'s a lot easier to be like, you know, fuck these Nazis than it is to say, yeah, I proactively support this group right I proactively, you know, like it would be even harder like having defund or abolish the police as a hashtag. Right. Amazing. Would that be if you could get that trending? But then you\\'d have to get a bunch of people who are willing to proactively make that statement in a positive way and that\\'s a big step. You know, we\\'re not just taking down an obvious racist here where you know, actually having to make a positive movement. Yeah, I mean, into the credit to some fans, there are folks who are using that opportunity to get to petitions and other kind of meaningful actionable content and information and non like bail funds and stuff like that. So you\\'ve got folks who are using that opportunity to lift up voices of those on the ground and different activist organizations but I think, you know, in general, being able to do something quickly. I mean, to be honest, an opportunity to drop a fan can and I mean a lot of this is like, just here\\'s more views from my fan can let me drop it in here it\\'s it\\'s quick and easy to do and yeah, I could just say like Black Lives Matter, but the police get a fan can and then peace out. It\\'s a low lift. It\\'s a low lift. You know, I think that\\'s the downside of any online activism that isn\\'t based around actual organizing principles with some strategy and thought and intentfulness behind it is always going to be kind of used for self-premission on a certain level. That\\'s why online activism kind of has to be created something more substantive. Yeah. It actually be effective. I wonder, do you think too. So one thing that\\'s been really striking about the activism of the last two weeks is how hyper local it is for a lot of people, particularly I mean at least in the US it has been in terms of like I have to assume that you are particularly invested in what the city of Chicago is doing and we are particularly invested in like with our fucking mayors doing and can I say that we\\'re clean podcast can I call them. I have been afraid to have as an invertebrate, which I think is probably too cruel to invertebrates, but he\\'s too tall for that he\\'s like whether people calling like a big bird looking mother fuck anyway. Fine. It\\'s fine. Again, people getting a lot of traction on a local level. I watch people, especially in bigger cities, but even in smaller towns be able to say like, here are the things that like here\\'s the city council meeting like if you can we\\'re going to call in and do all this stuff or like, you know, sign the specific thing talk to your specific community. I feel like Kpop is not the only thing that is most online fandoms are global in some way, but it seems like Kpop standard in particular is like very, very widely geographically distributed and so it feels like there\\'s a bit of a gap between like, I don\\'t know there\\'s there\\'s there\\'s a little bit of a disconnect view of these kind of very broad surfacey actions versus like the kinds of things that people who are doing actual organizing around more localized actionable things are doing. My question isn\\'t terribly well articulated, but does that make sense. Yeah, like I feel like it\\'s one of those depends on what circles, even within Kpop fandom. I honestly don\\'t know if I am the best gauge of things because I, as a black fan and an older black fan tend to connect with and interact with and follow other older black fans and the color fans, beer fans who are sure, sure clung into what\\'s happening on the level levels and so are kind of using that platform to speak out kind of more specifically and have more nuanced takes on what\\'s going on. But in general, yeah, you\\'re probably not going to see quite as specific anything that\\'s grounded in activism or organizing from fans who are new to this who just want to participate and do something in a role. And so, you know, there\\'s a particular change that or make it seems to be very popular among a lot of kpop fans want to spread the word. And that\\'s great. And you know, it\\'s a way to get people educated. It\\'s a form of political education and helping both kind of get up to speed but yeah it\\'s not going to be on the same level as somebody who\\'s a fan who\\'s also organizing within their communities and who, you know, who\\'s their timelines to talk about both of these things and flip back forth from those two worlds with a little bit more thoughtfulness. So yeah, but I think it\\'s hard because it is, it is where the most part there\\'s a lot of young fans. There\\'s a lot of global fans. This is their first time really thinking about or talking about a lot of this stuff So, like, and there\\'s a lot of just parroting of what other people say and do like to hear and say things it sounds good. You\\'re like, okay, this makes sense. So you people just kind of repeat a lot of what they hear from other fans like themselves, which is sometimes good and sometimes policies, depending on what is being shared. But I think in the case of beyond activism, I think where I tend to see a lot more Churchill, this comes from the folks who were already going to be doing organizing or activist work anyway. And it just also happened to be bands that it\\'s not necessarily coming from like a broader swoth or K-pop band and I think that\\'s when we get into there is diversity. There\\'s great diversity reform. K-pop bandin and coming and bringing in different parts of their identity to the fandom and it gets paid out in situations like this. You know, I think that you\\'re, what you\\'re saying kind of underscores my own kind of ignorant assumptions about K-pop fandom in the sense of like, of course what you\\'re saying like, oh, I have my friends within these spaces, just like that\\'s a fandom is, right? You know, like, I think that to me why it often looks different from the outside because I\\'ve never been in this kind of fandom and like, flourish, obviously you\\'re in a global music fandom as well around Western artists. But like, to me, I could never imagine like, I\\'ve going into like hashtags, whereas potentially connecting me to thousands, if not millions of people who like the thing that I like, like that\\'s not a part of my experience ever. And like the kind of, you know, like the kind of kind of fan of spaces I\\'m in. But like, that is definitely a part of K-pop. So to me, on the outside, it often looks like most people in K-pop are engaging in these like huge massive like thousands of people are on this hashtag doing this thing, whereas like, obviously what you\\'re saying makes total sense that they\\'re also people who are like, have smaller circles and mostly talk to just other fans who also like it and maybe, you know, have similar backgrounds, maybe don\\'t, but like, have a similar way of engaging, right? Like, so I apologize for like the framing of that. Yeah, yeah. But like, I think it\\'s useful to talk about, because I\\'m sure that other people and media fandom who aren\\'t in any music fandom may feel, may have the same assumptions that I have from the outside looking at this, you know? Yeah, I mean, it\\'s really, you know, I think with most fandoms, you\\'ll find if you look a little closer that it\\'s not quite as monolithic as might be seen from the outside in terms of like, different spheres of conversation, just different types of peripheral interests that bring folks together and then more demographic simileities that bring different fans together. And I feel like K-pop fandom is actually like, many fandoms, like it\\'s not just about even the groups, but it\\'s about some of those peripheral parts of identity that bring people together, whether you\\'re a Western fan versus an Asian fan, and then specifically, you know, whether you are a Caribbean fan versus a Vietnamese fan or a Thai fan. And so like, those geographical issues, there\\'s lots of different kind of sub-sets of communities of folks talking to each other, bringing some of those peripheral interests to the forefront, you know, and especially as an older fan who\\'s liked it for a bit longer, I do think, like you have your fans who come in and get a pass, like two of the years you have to want to have been in the K-pop for the past, then you could use yourself and they operate and communicate. And it\\'s usually talking about in generations, there\\'s generations that like, it\\'s argued whether this is now technically the third or fourth generation K-pop, but like, for example, I\\'m a second generation K-pop fan, I think, like the late 90s, early 2000s and the big 2008s groups that have come out and then you have other groups that have come later than that and they have their own kind of generation of fans, and so there\\'s like, different, or other different ways that fans communicate, talk to each other, how they interact and communicate, and then a lot of the conversation happens offline and chats and discords and like, and so that conversation moves in and out is like, all off the grid conversation that they\\'ve been playing out in Twitter. So like, oh, there\\'s so many different, it\\'s so diverse and not just thinking about race and ethnicity or the things that you know what we think about, there\\'s just so much variation in terms of how people do engage with K-pop, it\\'s not that dissimilar than other music bandings, I mean like as a metal form, I think it\\'s very similar where you have a different, like, you know, like hard-held core versus metal core versus grind core versus death metal versus black metal versus Norwegian black metal, and then in intersections of that where you have black movie, \"Jin, black metal fans\" versus black metal core fans, and like, we don\\'t even agree about what music we are, you know what I mean? So like, it\\'s not that dissimilar to other music bandings, but I think because of the stereotypes about K-pop as an industry, the fans, you know, a lot of those existing stereotypes about who the very gendered and racialized stereotypes about who likes this music and why, the consideration that it would be similar to other music bandings is in the event, like, thought of because it\\'s just kind of, you know, dismissed. Totally, and I feel like that brings us around to the like coverage of this in the media, which was, you know, I mean even from the outside, it was interesting to look at and see the simultaneous, like, the people going like, what, what, K-pop fans know what black lives matter means, and then, oh, K-pop fans are radicalizing and they\\'re going to save us all, you know, because all of these young presumed white, young white, suburban K-pop fans have learned all of a sudden and for the first time that race exists, and also, you know, they\\'re coming to save us, and then like also seeing people within fandom sort of different fandoms, not just K-pop, I mean, fandom broadly jumping on, being excited, and going, yeah, K-pop fandom is going to save us, fandom is going to save us, right? And like, you know, it\\'s like, yeah, I don\\'t know about that. I feel like it\\'s sort of sweet, right? Because at the same time, it\\'s like, this is, this is bad, but it\\'s also saying nice things about fandom and like, and people coming out and being like, what do we do with that? And you\\'re like, you guys. Yeah, they were kind of like, backhanded confidence. I think I was very much like, oh, look at these bubble-headed fans who actually are like, you know, learning about something other than, you know, finding over these fancy robots. Oh, wow, it\\'s amazing. Like, a lot of it felt like a, a candid confidence to me, and it was hard, you know, even, even outside of the lack of conversation about anti-blackness and just blackness in general, it all felt very, there is a little insulting, annoying, resiliency, or condescending, just in kind of how like mainstream media portrayed it. But it\\'s also a cute story. It\\'s one of those things that I feel like, you know, somebody would make a movie about it. Like, I was a little bit female, it\\'s really fangirl, and let\\'s see, change the world. Look at hashtag, in a span camp. Like, you know, it\\'s, it\\'s cute. Like, it\\'s, it\\'s a narrative that I could see why your average reporter, like, white male, probably older, gen whatsoever. It\\'s got so cool in the film. So correct. It\\'s amazing. If my, you know, my daughter, my granddaughter is a BTS fan, and she told me about this, I\\'m just, you know, I\\'m sure that was what happened in some of these movies somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. And they kind of play into like traditional stereotypes about fans too, right? Like, broadly, the idea of like the, the screaming horde of fan, fan girls from using fandom, right? Like, it\\'s totally a comfortable space to think about. Like, oh, we found the kind of activism that everyone can understand. A screaming horde just came and did that. You know, it\\'s like, okay. Oh, yeah. You know, that\\'s great. Yeah. Let\\'s, let\\'s dig into, since we brought it up and also like, you know, going back to the, like, back a few clicks to, when you\\'re talking about how it\\'s actually like super diverse in a lot of different ways and different engage ways of engaging, but also different backgrounds and all over the world and et cetera. And when you talk about, I think we should talk about the anti-blackness part. And one thing that I left out of my bullet points in the beginning is the K-pop artists themselves, which I feel like is an inextricable part of this too, because it\\'s my understanding that some of this is black fans and their allies critiquing the silences or the poor responses or the historical anti-blackness from these artists. And then people getting angry that their faves are being critiqued. Is that the heart of it or is it like much, much more complicated than that? It\\'s a longer history than that. And I feel like that\\'s, it\\'s all kind of come to a head with what\\'s happening in this moment because there are black fans, including myself, who want to hear from these artists knowing that so many of them, knowing that K-pop is built, it\\'s inspired by and appropriating the music of African-American and black cultures. It\\'s lifted directly from hip-hop and R&B. And so for many black fans, it\\'s like knowing that K-pop is drawn from this, at the very least, just let us know that you\\'ve given it on some level, that you have some level of solidarity with black people considering that the music and culture and aesthetic is so important to your careers. And so it all kind of came to a head with that, but the decades now, black fans and other allies, black fans leading the way in this, there\\'s an artist who will have culturally appropriated hair, like black hairstyles or do something in black things. And it happens way more often than people want to talk about or use the N-word in a song. You have black fans who will call out and say, \"This is not, this is unacceptable. This is offensive. This is wrong.\" And then you have non-black fans saying, \"Shut up, basically. We don\\'t want to hear it. This isn\\'t the place for that.\" Or, \"You should be grateful. You should be proud.\" Or, \"It wasn\\'t offensive to me for...\" And it\\'s not about you, you\\'re not black. And this has been ongoing for since the start of K-pop\\'s rise here in the US and the Western world for decades now, or at least many, many years, where black fans bring this up. Struggle with it, struggle with whether you want to continue to support this, either the artists or the music in general, or at the very least, bringing it up and pointing it out and calling out artists and calling out fans for a ready-up slide. And that is often not responded to with support. It\\'s often responded to with harassment with fans with them dogs, with them to get pictures of lynchings sent to them, like just really horrible harassment. And this has happened for many, many years. And this, you know, across the board, this isn\\'t pointing any finger at when artists, because they probably, like, there are very few K-pop artists that have not had some kind of cultural appropriation scandal in the past few years. You can just go down the list. Almost nobody is completely free from it. And just having those broader conversations about race, about cultural appropriation, about just, like, what it means, especially in, with having diverse fan base and you have music, you know, just the role and the influence of black music and culture on music in general and kind of the devaluation of actual black creatives while black music and culture is celebrated within different genres. And having those tough conversations, even trying to have an entry point to them, is met with violence and met with antagonism and anger by white K-pop fans or just non-black K-pop fans. And this is not you at all. But I think this is kind of a boiling point because it\\'s such a crucial moment. And I think a lot of fans are just fed up and want to see even, even if the response is like a bare minimum, just some acknowledgement that there\\'s some solidarity there. And so, I mean, the fight is going to continue. Black fans are going to keep moving this up long after this moment is over. But I think just seeing it not really acknowledged is because of the aforementioned, like, dismisses of the legitimacy of the music overall, whether it\\'s black music and culture or music from Asian artists, like all of it, it\\'s not, there\\'s not enough actual critical discussion about these genres on a broader level anyway. And so, like, the entry point is very surface level. So we can\\'t even have those K-01 or three-01 level conversations because we\\'re still like screaming girls and dancing models. Right, right. That\\'s what the mainstream reporting knows about it. They haven\\'t bothered to think about where does the music come from? There have been conversations about this in the past because here you talk about this and this history, like, you\\'ve told us a little bit about before, but this history of these debates happening within K-pop fandoms, it\\'s like, how can you see that and then say, \"Oh, isn\\'t it shocking that K-pop just learned about race and suddenly got on board with Black Lives Matter?\" You know what I mean? Like, no, that\\'s not... Right, right. That\\'s not what happened. I don\\'t know what did happen, but wasn\\'t that. Yeah. I mean, it\\'s good in that I feel like there are, you know, especially in the past people being more articles that have gotten into that a little bit more, that it\\'s, as with a lot of discussions right now, you have, like, decades worth of discourse being stuffed into, like, one 800-word article. And it\\'s never been to be enough because these are articles and conversations and whatnot that should have been a part of, you know, especially music writing for JUMP. This should not be the first time we should be having these conversations about anti-Blackness and K-pop and all of this, like, in 2020, this should have been, like, a bunch of books, a bunch of articles, like, a whole bunch of stuff and welding stone. This should have been, happened. So the fact that it\\'s now we\\'re here, it\\'s never going to really give it what it deserves because we should be at the 201, 301, 401 level of this conversation within, you know, music writing, cultures and pop culture anyway. And that, those were a lot of issues with the recent fandom, like, you know. Yeah, I mean, even just fandom in general, like, as a fandom journalist, the number of times where I\\'ve had to, like, go over the 101 stuff, when it\\'d be, like, genuinely, like, I don\\'t have enough space to go in and then you want to talk about critical fandom stuff regardless of the topic and you have a paragraph. And so then it feels, like, weirdly shoehorned in and it\\'s like, there\\'s a reason why I don\\'t really write from mainstream publications anymore. And I see those parallels happening in the music. Like, you know, there are people who are on the K-pop beat, now major publications, but it really often feels like they turn into kind of trade reporters and they\\'re not speaking across, like, they\\'re talking about what\\'s happening just in K-pop and they\\'re not speaking across these barriers. And so then you get what happened in the last two weeks or people are like, well, K-pop, have you heard of it? Well, they are well-weted. Right. Yes. No, no girls. Right. Yeah. And that\\'s a real shame. And I talk about that a lot. I\\'ve been with a lot of the lot. It\\'s a real shame that there\\'s not a whole lot of space for critical writing about K-pop. I mean, it\\'s kind of a hard time for critical music writing in a way in general. But it\\'s a real shame that K-pop has become bigger than ever here in Mikey. You do not have a history of library, of backlogs, of mainstream critical writing that puts a lot of this in any kind of context. And there\\'s a lot of musicality and just really interesting things to talk about in the same way that K-pop has been saying about this music. But it\\'s not there. And there are plenty of fantastic writers who could go in. I know or know of most of them. They are out there and ready to write about this stuff. But it\\'s just not a whole lot of space for publications to go deep on it. And that\\'s a real shame because that\\'s why so much is lost. And the reporting on this because it\\'s like you said, it\\'s the whole world. Look at these wacky girls and the wacky dancey models. And it never gets any deeper than that even though the story itself is completely different than the mode of that is being spring. I think there is a general knowledge gap for a lot of people considering how important K-pop is to so many people. I mean, I was astonished coming into this to discover that I was talking with a person who\\'s a very well respected person who studies anonymous and hackers on the internet. And I had to explain to her that yes, K-pop makes Twitter hashtags trend a lot. I was like, in the top 10, I was like, yeah, it\\'s just like, did they normally go above a million? And I was like, well, yes, I don\\'t know what to say. Yes, if you look at the top hashtags, like out of the top 10, like four of them are BTS. Hold on. In her defense, well, not really because obviously she probably had Twitter more than a year ago, but like Twitter has changed to algorithm. So it\\'s not only K-pop hashtags, but it was hard to miss that period when it was only K-pop hashtags. Not to mention it\\'s still the top 10 most liked tweets ever. Like three of them are BTS related. And that\\'s just BTS, you know what I mean? So it was just a moment where I was like, we have been living on different internet and yet you are supposed to be, I mean, you are a person who\\'s very knowledgeable about the internet. I don\\'t mean say supposed to be, you know, but it\\'s just amazing that sort of awareness gap, you know? And I think it goes, I mean, obviously it\\'s deep in music, but I think it\\'s everywhere. I agree. I mean, it\\'s so funny because I feel like it\\'s not just that, but I think about like, and this is going really, really bad, but there were so many instances where I talked about scandal and then scandal was really popping off and black TV fans talking about scandal and I would go into places where like my job, which is digital strategy and talk about scandal, conversations about scandal and people were like, what? I don\\'t understand. So they\\'re talking about scandal on Twitter. And these are folks who are in digital strategy and social media. And they don\\'t know. So I think a lot of it is just, I don\\'t know, willful ignorance, just not seeing what\\'s in plain sight, but I don\\'t know how you can\\'t see K-pop even when you\\'re trying not to look for it or just trim the drop of the hat daily. If not hourly, it\\'s always there. You know, there are so many subcultures online who are basically hiding in plain sight and having these conversations and they being kind of still in and out of the general public\\'s conversation and discourse that it\\'s maybe not always seen or acknowledged as important unless something game changing happens, even though it\\'s like always there, it\\'s like, okay, we\\'re not going to notice it until it\\'s huge, but it\\'s always there. Those subcultures are there. Those communities are there. Those conversations are there. It\\'s just that people who just won\\'t see it unless they\\'re forced to. Because I\\'m always thinking about it from this level I always feel like it does get into the other spheres of marketization and stratification in terms of who gets listened to, if you voices are seen as powerful and important and at what kind of favorite reasons, you know, so it\\'s easy to, like, not to something that\\'s there. If you don\\'t think the people who are talking have anything to say. That\\'s so well put. I hate to keep asking questions, but I got to ask you at least one more. Okay, so one thing I was thinking about today, there were some conversations on my feed with fan studies, scholars of color talking about transformative fandom and racism and some of it was just trying to get people even on that one-on-one page, you know, which, like, people have been talking about this for years also. Like, I don\\'t know why this is breaking news for anyone. But one thing that I was thinking a lot about today was we\\'ve had this scholar Rick Winnie Ponday on the show multiple times to talk about racism and fandom. And I feel like at least once, possibly multiple times, she\\'s talked about how she\\'s talking about media fandom, but I know there are parallels with other kinds of fandoms too, that fans of color really only get to have these conversations about racism or anti-blackness or any particular subset of racialized bigotry. When there\\'s a crisis point, like, she was talking about race fail. Maybe you initially talked to her during a Star Wars shipping and race, you know, like, meltdown of a massive conversation. And like, this is a crisis point, but it\\'s like, just of everything. Like, this isn\\'t just about any, like, fandom thing or K-pop or anything, but like, it\\'s across, across the whole sphere. And it just feels like it\\'s a little bit of the flip side. This is, this is an opportunity for, like, white people in particular to, like, start apologizing, like, the door is wide open right now to be like, I hear all the ways I fucked up, right? And I\\'m just wondering if you feel like you\\'re seeing any, like, reckoning with that, like, cognitive dissonance between K-pop fans saying Black Lives Matter, but still persisting in being violently anti-black in fandom spaces, right? Or like, people acknowledging. Do you know what I mean? I, I feel like this is a little bit rambling, but it\\'s sort of like, no, it makes, it makes sense to me. Like, is, no time like the press is there any actual, is there any actual, is there any actual personal responsibility taking or reckoning with their own actions or like the way that the culture is or is it all pointed to the outside? These bad people outside of our culture, we\\'re going to go after that. Yeah. I think that\\'s a good summarizing of this very stumbling question that I\\'m trying to participate with all the ideas at once. But does that make sense? Yeah, I, I take whatever you want out of that, go with it. Just ignore me. Yeah. Get me. It\\'s the question. Ask the question you wish. Yeah, that\\'s the question. Don\\'t worry about it. I\\'m spitballing. I\\'m sorry. No, I think I get it. I, I guess, unfortunately, because I don\\'t really have a very positive answer to that. Like, I don\\'t think anything is going to change. There\\'s so much denial around that anything is even wrong. And I\\'m talking specifically about K-pop\\'s name. There are people who in one tweet would be like, localized matter. And then in the next tweet, flarately a cackle black fan, they\\'re not, so there\\'s not, there\\'s not any, there is that cognitive dissonance that it, and there\\'s not a connection. You can\\'t have cognitive dissonance without cognition about the dissonance. Sorry, that was a little mean. I couldn\\'t help. Please, please don\\'t kill me, J-pop fans. It\\'s fine. But yeah, at least internally, I don\\'t think there\\'s going to be that much change. Maybe we will see more voices, more diverse voices, writing and doing critical writing about K-pop. Maybe. But I don\\'t, I don\\'t know if that\\'s going to even exist outside of the end of this month. I think it\\'s, it is like a crisis moment. It\\'s something where you can get those voices, whether those voices will be invited to write about music or K-pop or anything after this moment. I honestly don\\'t know, but I honestly don\\'t think so. Like I think as with anything structural, the change is slow, the change is painful, the change is incremental and whatever changes we see within fandom racism, it\\'s, it\\'s not going to be a sea change. It\\'s not going to be an immediate ticket to something better. It\\'s going to be slow and incremental. And I think, you know, a lot of the folks who really are doing the work may not even be in the fandom to benefit from the changes that happen. Because I do, I think there will be a lot of, at least in K-pop, a lot of Black fans who this would be it for them. They will be it for you guys. And you know, and there will be fans that stay in the end and do the work that I ate. And they are doing work. I did want to quickly shout out that there is a hashtag going on right now called SM Black Out, one of the, one of the companies, SM Entertainment, and they do employ a lot of Black songwriters and producers and so a lot of fans who are using the hashtag to say, like, we would like to see a show of solidarity considering how many Black theaters you have, like, who write your hits. We just want to hear from the company knowing that you are in solidarity with us. And like, that\\'s really heartening to see because it is like, it\\'s industry based, it\\'s fandom based, it\\'s specifically Black fans and allies saying this, this is what we want, this is in. And that is, I would love to see more of that. I think if there\\'s a happy or at least a positive result of this is that kind of critical activism within fandom and calling out fandom in the industry might be a result of this. Because that\\'s needed on a lot of levels, K-pop anime is notoriously bad about that kind of internal critical fandom. There\\'s a lot of companies fans, they\\'re like, the company is great, we love their big family and we\\'re, we\\'re their children and it\\'s like, and I, that\\'s so interesting. Yeah. And so it would be really great to see that kind of critique of the industry itself in a critique of, yeah, that just seeing that is, is hopeful. But I honestly don\\'t know about like structural basis in fandom, all fandoms basically. That\\'s like, that\\'s like trying to, you know, just, there\\'s so much happening right now. And honestly, like with the companies that are finally folks and it\\'s like, that\\'s, and like making brown bandids, like, all of this stuff where you had decades, decades, and centuries, whatever to do it. And today, this week you decided that this thing that people have been talking about for years and years, oh, I guess we shouldn\\'t do this anymore. It\\'s suddenly like good business did cut to you, at least outwardly say that you care about black people, but like, this moment will be over and will you still care? Will black people still mean something to you once this isn\\'t a trending topic? And I think that\\'s my big thing. That\\'s what I hope we\\'ll see more of is within fandom, fans and okay, this is structural, like how do we, it\\'s not just about loving your faves, but like what\\'s going on in the industry and how can we speak to that and maybe some critical mass around that would be fantastic. That\\'s what I hope to see that, I don\\'t know. Go back to me a year, don\\'t tell you. You put a pretty helpful spin on things, like, it\\'s- I want to believe, I want to believe just because I feel like there are so many people trying to really be some good stuff. Yeah, okay, well, sorry. I mean, let\\'s see, right, I mean, what\\'s there to do, but see, right? Time does march forward. I also, my cynical me is like, just get corporations to give as much as they can right now, even if this is like a temporary thing, just like, milk it, you know, like just- That\\'s what I feel like, you know what, write a check, it is like, honestly, I\\'m totally down with just like, write a game of a check. I would be, you know, bare me at a whatever, write a check. I\\'m down with that. Right, it\\'s just like, if you\\'re going to make a black JPEG with white letters, it should include we are donating a significant amount of money right now. Yes. Just donating it, you know, you know, if you\\'re a large person. All right, so on that note, I think the takeaway of this, this episode was write a check. Great. But seriously, it\\'s always a pleasure to have you on Kydre and you\\'re great. And this is a great conversation is the summary. Oh yeah. Thank you. You\\'re great. Thank you so much. It\\'s always a blessing. Okay, wonderful. We\\'ll have you on at least a year from now, if not sooner. All right. Bye. Bye. It is truly always a delight to hear from Kydre. Yes, 100%. And like one of these days, it should be about metal fandom. Because she\\'s just helping. I really want to know. I\\'m slipping in these references and I\\'m like, wait, what? Tell me more about Norwegian flag. Black death metal versus like the subcategories. I want to know. Yeah, it\\'s a, it\\'s a, it\\'s all a world of mystery to me. So okay, but we really should talk about the, the Trump Tulsa rally, which is the sort of continuation of this story since we spoke to Kydre. And I don\\'t think that anything that Kydre said has been made outdated or anything like that. I think that this is just a continuation of all of the things that, that we were talking about really. Yeah. I do think, well, I, I slightly disagree with you. I think there\\'s a, there\\'s a little bit of a new facet to this story. So basically what happened is Trump held this rally and they really hyped it. And the, the organizers, his like campaign manager were constantly talking about how it was astronomical reservations, like 800,000 reservations and just huge hype. And obviously that\\'s the, there\\'s a reason why they would do that regardless of whether it was true or not. And to the point where the people who are going, and you know, this, this rally was also notable because it was originally scheduled for June 19th, which is June, team, and they chose that deliberately. People said they did that on purpose. And then they said they did do it on purpose. So they changed it to June 20th because they were expecting some backlash, but not that much, which is just an incredible, the times when you\\'re like, did you do this on purpose? Do you being the Trump administration or are you just incompetent? And the answer sometimes is both, like you did it, you did it on purpose to be awful, but also you didn\\'t do it very well and like, et cetera. Anyway, so this was on June 20th and people have been camping out like for days to get seats, right? Supposedly. Yeah. And then it turns out that huge portions of the stick. I\\'m sorry. It is funny. Those tickets were reserved by various organized groups of people on the internet, including K-pop stands as well as, quote, TikTok teens, which I\\'m not exactly sure what organized group of TikTok teens we\\'re talking about. And you know, classic, I mean, people are trying to say this wasn\\'t a prank, but like classic prank stuff going on here. People were saying like, they were using the names that you wrote or a fake pizza with. Yeah, Mike Hunt. Yes, you know, like the most classic. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m a juvenile. And so this, this launched a very large fresh round of will the K-pop stands save us. Right. And lots of debate also about like the functionality of this and what they actually did, right? You know, people saying, oh, they, they don\\'t have to press turnout. Well, no, they didn\\'t actually, but it is inflate visions of who would show up and then people go, oh, no, what it actually was. It was a, was an operation so that Trump couldn\\'t use any of those like signups for mailing lists, which is actually true, right? You know, now, now they basically poured sugar in the gas can as it were. Right. And it\\'s impossible to sort out who the actual supporters are. The, yeah, I should clarify because I didn\\'t say there was no cap on signups. So that\\'s why people were showing up early, the people who did want to go. But right. The actual attendees were in the numbered in the few, few thousands is my understanding. I mean, even though it was a venue that could hold like a hundred thousand people. Yeah. So like no one was shut out because they had reserved a finite number of tickets at all. Right. So, you know, just to just to keep the facts on the table here. But you know, we got like, we got like liberal politicians and like Alexandra, Kazio Cortez being like, Hey, K. Castan\\'s like, thanks, you know, that the stupidest take was that this was a coordinated, you saw the one that was like something coordinated with North and South Korea? Yes. And I was like, North and South Korea. Whoa. Getting spicy in here. Those are some spicy takes. Oh, God. So it\\'s just like the whole thing. It is really frustrating too because there\\'s an element of this, this part of it. And I, I feel the same way about the stuff that was going and that we were discussing about with Kydra. There\\'s certainly like a Columbus thing element to it. Like, you know, the expression, Columbus thing being when people act like they\\'ve discovered something that a group has been doing for years or has been studying for years, the continent of North America, you know, and like there\\'s a, for all the correct critiques that like the stuff that we were discussing with Kydra, like K-pop stands aren\\'t this monolithic, like, you know, white teen girls in the suburbs who just learned about politics three days ago or now three weeks ago, you know, that aside, like one thing that I\\'ve seen a lot of in the last 12 hours or so since this happens, recording of the day after the Trump rally is a lot of people acting like no groups of enthusiasts around anything have ever done these tactics or organize in this way. And like, you know, in particular, I saw a good commentary about how this diminishes the, the political online organizing work of like black millennials in particular. Yeah. And the things that they did over the last decade on social media were seen as disruption were unwanted disruption, whereas this is, oh, there are saviors, these K-pop stands, you know. Well, and one of the things I thought was funny about that, we may even be talking about the same thread is that in that thread, I think the point, the one I\\'m thinking of anyhow, the point was, oh, well, now that it\\'s white TikTok teens and white K-pop stands, now you pay attention, but what black millennials were doing wasn\\'t paid attention to, which I thought, well, yeah, I mean, you\\'re right about the generational point, but that\\'s also pretending that most K-pop fans are white, which I understand is like the narrative, but I\\'m not sure that it\\'s actually true if you\\'re talking globally. And you know, and as we talked about with Kydra, like it\\'s, it\\'s a very, you know, the diversity of K-pop stands and frankly diversity of people on TikTok, right? It\\'s like, right. This is, this is a false narrative in itself that it\\'s white people doing this. Right. I mean, you know, I think Kydra had a great point. She was tracking the people who were writing about this being like, my daughter is a BTS fan and I just learned about this, you know? But like, I think it\\'s a real reflection. It just shows the way this is sort of trickled down into who even gets to write about it and who is asked to comment about it. And if you think this is a story worth covering, it makes me think a lot about all the arguments I\\'ve had over the years, not necessarily arguments, maybe overstating it. You know, discussions I\\'ve had with editors about what fan stories are worth even bothering with or like, oh, this is just a niche thing. Like the general public isn\\'t going to care about this, which has always been really frustrating because then it has to reach some sort of international crisis point like game or gate for it to matter, right? And for it to wind up as like a segment on NPR. And I\\'d always just thought it\\'s such a reflection of the people doing the assigning, not so much the, the, the people who could write about it. And because you\\'re deciding what\\'s a valid story. And there is a, you know, the big thread throughout the last month of this, the K-pop narratives to me is like, why did you just think this was something to talk about now? And then when you think where you think the story is and who you choose to talk to, to quote or who you choose to assign it to, you know, like even that first, the first story that Teen Vogue ran about anti-blackness to kind of correct the narrative of like, look, K-pop loves Black Lives Matter, it was to be like also, but they, they assigned it to a white person, you know, and it\\'s just like, you know, this is something that we\\'ve been struggling with over the last few weeks about like, you know, how has two white people, how much or should we be talking, right? Like the balance between like using a platform versus just white-spaining around all around the, the internet. But a publication doesn\\'t have like commission a black writer, right? This is not that hard, you know? Like you have more than two people at your publication, then perhaps you should consider. Like if your, your method of publishing is that you commission writers to write stories and it could be any old writer, like anyone at all, then like, why are you hiring a white writer to do this? Like they\\'re, you know, like, yeah. And similarly, like if you are a white writer, because I\\'m sure there are people, they\\'re journalists who listen to this podcast or academic, this is a very good time to suggest someone else, you know? Like, I don\\'t know. It\\'s not, it\\'s not that complicated to me. Yeah. But it\\'s just, it\\'s frustrating to see this being perpetuated after there was really good substantive critique of the way the media handled this like two weeks ago to just see this immediately. It\\'s like, I don\\'t know. I made a joke about this morning that I was like, oh, I would say we\\'re in the second wave of this, but I think we never left the, left the first wave. Oh no. Like, you know, it\\'s like coronavirus. You know, you get it. But like, yeah, no, I got it. It does. But I got it. It\\'s sad, but it feels that way to me. It\\'s like, well, you didn\\'t learn any lessons two weeks ago. Yeah, it\\'s true. It\\'s really true. I don\\'t know. And it\\'s actually, if anything, it\\'s only getting worse. I think that the other, the other piece of this is that if all of your, if all of your fancy people that you would normally have as a go to for crisis moments are white people. Yeah. And then, and older white people and men and people who don\\'t know anything about youth culture and all of this stuff, right? Whatever particular constellation of those. And then you don\\'t cover this stuff until it gets to a crisis point. Mm hmm. And of course, they\\'re going to be looking like they\\'re colombusing it. Yeah. You don\\'t even know where to start. Right. Yeah, exactly. Right. Like how do you, you know, I mean, and understanding that when things get to a crisis point, maybe, maybe it\\'s suddenly a really big story and you want to give it to someone who, who you know is really like, okay, fine. But like, you\\'re in this position because of the way that who those people are too, you know, right? Right. Yeah. All right. Cool. Now I\\'m depressed. Yeah, that\\'s great. All right. Well, it\\'s like maybe a good time to wind this down. I think that we are nearly out of time. Something that I want to say about the one thing I want to say before we wrap up and go to like, you know, outro business is I want to very briefly mention the OTW stuff. Absolutely. Yeah. So as many of you guys may know, the organization for transformative works did not do a great job of communicating about Black Lives Matter. And by that, I mean, they didn\\'t put out a statement for a really long time. No, they didn\\'t put out as, as, as of this recording Sunday, June 21st. They do not put out a statement at all. Yesterday they committed to putting out a statement. Right. And instead of doing this, they posted a news roundup that quoted among other people, or cited, I should say, among other people, Rukmini Ponde and Stitch, people who have been on this podcast before as people who have worked in racism and fandom and written about this. And then didn\\'t seem to take on board any of their criticisms or have any awareness that they should be taking those on board. I know the individuals at the OTW know this and have thought about this, but as an institution, they did not communicate that, did not seem to be interested in engaging with it at all. And this went down like a lead balloon. Yeah. As you might well imagine, and is it absolutely should have? So over the last week, we\\'ve been talking about it on our social media feeds, but just wanted to mention it here in case you haven\\'t seen it. We signed an open letter, which you also may have seen, though I guess this hypothetical person who doesn\\'t have social media wouldn\\'t have seen it either, asking for some fairly basic things. They are specific and substantive, but they\\'re not prescriptive. Yeah. They\\'re not saying the A03 should change this the next way or transformative works and cultures, which is the academic journal that the OTW runs should do why specific thing. I think those kind of recommendations are not ones that should be made without really careful, substantive thought and listening and input from a lot of different fans because one thing that I had a really hard time with the last week is, and I\\'ve been really stressing this is I\\'ve seen some kind of knee jerk defensiveness around the idea of ever making any changes to anything at all. Often when you dig into it a little bit, the person who\\'s being defensive has one specific idea about what this would mean, and they don\\'t like it. And sometimes the idea is something that I don\\'t think is a great idea. I\\'ll be like, \"Yeah, you\\'re right. I don\\'t think they should do that either. I don\\'t think that\\'s feasible or I could list seven reasons why I also don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea.\" But then that leads to like, \"So nothing can change and we can\\'t discuss this.\" And it\\'s like, right, we first had these writers and scholars in question on in our big early race and fandom episode, which was four years ago. One thing that we did say on social media is we\\'ve committed to doing a follow up to that because while we\\'ve had guests of color talk about racism and fandom, we haven\\'t had anything like that with a lot of voices at once. But one thing that always struck me about that from the very beginning is that there was disagreement in differences in perspective from all those guests because of course there were. They were eight different individuals with different backgrounds and different relationships to fandom. There\\'s no monolith and no one is demanding that the AO3 must change and do the X certain thing. And the defensiveness just really gets in the way of good faith conversations about racism and fandom, which is like, does this hurt you to talk about this? It\\'s not, you know, I don\\'t know. It\\'s just been a pretty disappointing, unsurprising, disappointing reaction to me. You know what I mean? Absolutely. Anyway, we will include a link to that open letter in our show notes and just so people understand where that comes from. Mostly a group of mostly academics drafted it. A variety of people have a variety of different races. It was signed by a lot of academics. We were part of the group who were sort of commenting on it as it was going forward. It\\'s by no means, you know, something\\'s saying X or Y, you have to do this, you have to do that. It\\'s more saying we call on you to actually think about this and that\\'s incredibly important. And so I think that we would urge you to sign it as well and to basically keep telling the O2W that this needs to be a major topic of conversation. This needs to be something that is explored as we move forward because otherwise nothing\\'s going to change and that\\'s actually not good. Anyway, by the time this comes out, this O2W may have already released a statement. So this then, and maybe we\\'ll have feelings about it. So this might be moot. Like, definitely it\\'s a conversation that we encourage all listeners and readers to engage in. Absolutely. I think that makes it about time for us to wrap up. So I\\'m just going to quickly mention a couple of things that you can do to support our podcast also because, you know, as we\\'ve said, we\\'re planning on doing a lot more around a lot of these topics in the coming months.

prescriptive yeah saying change next way transformative works cultures academic journal otw runs specific thing think kind recommendations ones made without really careful substantive thought listening input lot different fans one thing really hard time last week really stressing seen kind knee jerk defensiveness around idea ever making changes anything often dig little bit person defensive one specific idea would mean like sometimes idea something think great idea like yeah right think either think feasible could list seven reasons also think good idea leads like nothing change discuss like right first writers scholars question big early race fandom episode four years ago one thing say social media committed follow guests color talk racism fandom anything like lot voices one thing always struck beginning disagreement differences perspective guests course eight different individuals different backgrounds different relationships fandom monolith one demanding must

Thatâs why we deliver this podcast. Itâs important that people on-the-go learn what Godâs Word has to say, and the arguments that creationists use to rely on the authority of Scripture and make sense of secular science claims.&lt;/p&gt;</td>\n",

We jump right in with a discussion about the most recent headlines sparked by the protests following George Floydâs death. A lot of legislation has been crafted in response to the protests, including an executive order from President Donald Trump. We examine the organizations he listed during the signing to determine the intent of the order, followed by looking at the text of the order itself. Once created, tools can be used for good and evil. Then we discuss CHOP, the occupation movement in Capitol Hill, Washington. The Seattle City Council crafted resolutions in response to the leverage held by the CHOP protestors joined by protests across the nation. Seattle chose to ban the use of chokeholds, riot control weapons, and officers covering their badge numbers. We weigh in on #DefundPolice and how useful it can be in sparking a conversation, but why does the âdefundingâ stop at police? Then we finally tackle the Mormon angle by examining the recent rulings in the Supreme Court concerning churches being ânon-essentialâ services and LGBTQ+ people actually being people with Title VII protections. We wrap the episode with some great media for understanding racism in America as well as coming out as gay to your family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-weight: 400;'&gt;Links:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our format includes chit-chat, astroweather forecasts, news of the weird, guest conversation and then maybe live call-ins! Nox Mente is our old show dedicated to exploring consciousness through dreams, dreaming, and dream theory using a wide angle lens. We have opened up this conversation to a diverse world of dreamers. Our goal is to help in the process of bringing conscious intent to the state of dreaming â light to the shadowy corners of this experience we all have access to, each time we drift off to sleep.We strive to maintain an open and neutral environment as hosts. There are many theories on the process of dreaming and altered states, and we want to hear them all. No information is irrelevant when it comes to dreams. It is in the overlap of individual experiences that we find pathways into the thinking and journeys of the collective.Join our Discord server for more real time chatter</td>\n",

On this episode DaSai & Kris (@_k2times, @gramsandscvms) give you the latest on whatâs happening locally and nationally: from the most recent police brutality and racism events to Detroit Villians getting exposed throughout these trying times. The video about Jewell Jones we bring up can be found on @pardonmewithp Instagram page in his Instagram Tv section. Support and shop business.

<p>Beyond Trek presents it's Capstone entry in our Character Assassination series. The spotlight falls on none other than the very man, myth, and most legendary Starfleet Captain himself - Jean-Luc Picard. Join us as we deconstruct his character arc and relationships as presented in Star Trek Picard, finding our hero's resolve adrift in the tides of ennui. All this and more in the Star Trek: Picard character assassina-, we mean analysis, of Jean-Luc Picard.</p><p>Patreon: <a href='https://www.patreon.com/BeyondTrek'>https://www.patreon.com/BeyondTrek</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFmPvJ7P5lxIVunQZyBa2A'>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeFmPvJ7P5lxIVunQZyBa2A</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href='http://www.twitter.com/beyondtrekpod'>http://www.twitter.com/beyondtrekpod</a> (or @BeyondTrekPod)</p><p>Facebook: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/BeyondTrekProductions'>https://www.facebook.com/BeyondTrekProductions</a></p><p>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/beyondtrekpodcast/'>https://www.instagram.com/beyondtrekpodcast</a></p>--- Support this podcast: <a href='https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/beyondtrekpodcast/support' rel='payment'>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/beyondtrekpodcast/support</a>   \n",

North Omaha is screaming full of history, and the new 24th and Lake Historic District is a tremendous example of how thatâs so. After its first developments in the 1870s, this intersection evolved to become a hotbed of the African American community; as well as the heart of the Jewish community; a farm supply area; and much, much more. In 2016, 38 buildings were included in a new listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

       "22  <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Lots of interlocking stories to discuss this week. We jump right in with a discussion about the most recent headlines sparked by the protests following George Floydâs death. A lot of legislation has been crafted in response to the protests, including an executive order from President Donald Trump. We examine the organizations he listed during the signing to determine the intent of the order, followed by looking at the text of the order itself. Once created, tools can be used for good and evil. Then we discuss CHOP, the occupation movement in Capitol Hill, Washington. The Seattle City Council crafted resolutions in response to the leverage held by the CHOP protestors joined by protests across the nation. Seattle chose to ban the use of chokeholds, riot control weapons, and officers covering their badge numbers. We weigh in on #DefundPolice and how useful it can be in sparking a conversation, but why does the âdefundingâ stop at police? Then we finally tackle the Mormon angle by examining the recent rulings in the Supreme Court concerning churches being ânon-essentialâ services and LGBTQ+ people actually being people with Title VII protections. We wrap the episode with some great media for understanding racism in America as well as coming out as gay to your family.</span></p> <p>Â </p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Links:</span></p> <p>Â </p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Trumpâs Executive Order on Police Reform</span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'><br /></span><a href= 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/'><span style='font-weight: 400;'>https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities</span></a></p> <p>Â </p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Orgs mentioned during EO signing</span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'><br /></span><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>Federal law enforcement officers association</span> <a href= 'https://www.fleoa.org/news.aspx?id=19'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.fleoa.org/news.aspx?id=19</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Fraternal order of police</span> <a href='https://www.fop.net/CmsPage.aspx?id=39'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.fop.net/CmsPage.aspx?id=39</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Internal ass of chiefs of police</span> <a href='https://www.theiacp.org/'><span style= 'font-weight: 400;'>https://www.theiacp.org/</span></a></p> <p><span style='font-weight: 400;'>Intl union of police association;

            <p>A number of unusual, unexplained events have occurred in Michaelâs life. A natural skeptic, he often finds himself at odds with his own experiences. Now the cryptic symbolism in his strange experiences has begun to slowly decode itself before his eyes.

Itâs the back story behind the big story,Â and a look at all that goes into reporting at WRAL News. The news you see on TV and read online is the end product of hours of workÂ by many people: research, interviews,Â calls, meetings,Â following stories day in and day out.Each week, WRAL News Executive Producer Ashley Talley sits down with journalistsÂ to dig into the intricacies of coveringÂ one ofÂ the big storiesÂ of the week. Weâll talk about the process, the questionsÂ and the often difficultÂ decisions thatÂ goÂ into whatÂ weÂ cover and howÂ we coverÂ it.Â Occasionally, weâll also bring you conversations with WRAL journalists about their journey in this profession and the memorable stories theyâve covered.How to Commit Journalism is a production of WRAL News and part of the Capitol Broadcasting podcast network.   \n",

Our format includes chit-chat, astroweather forecasts, news of the weird, guest conversation and then maybe live call-ins! Nox Mente is our old show dedicated to exploring consciousness through dreams, dreaming, and dream theory using a wide angle lens. We have opened up this conversation to a diverse world of dreamers. Our goal is to help in the process of bringing conscious intent to the state of dreaming â light to the shadowy corners of this experience we all have access to, each time we drift off to sleep.We strive to maintain an open and neutral environment as hosts. There are many theories on the process of dreaming and altered states, and we want to hear them all. No information is irrelevant when it comes to dreams. It is in the overlap of individual experiences that we find pathways into the thinking and journeys of the collective.Join our Discord server for more real time chatter   \n",

One of the trainees was on his third day on the job. That got me thinking: How are police trained? What type of education do police officers receive? And are there any connections between type and quality of education and training to the excessive police force so common in black communities? My guest today is Gary Cordner, a retired professor and dean, former police officer and former police chief. Most recently he served as Chief Research Advisor for the National Institute of Justice in the U.S. Department of Justice. He has actively studied and written about community policing, police administration, police agency accreditation, and police education. We spoke last week on a range of issues including structural racism and the prospects of defunding the police.https://www.freshedpodcast.com/garycordner/ â--Get in touch!Twitter: @FreshEdpodcastFacebook: FreshEdEmail: info@freshedpodcast.comSupport FreshEd: http://www.freshedpodcast.com/support/                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",
      "| <p>This is a special episode of Changes BIG and small. I put out this episode in support of justice for George Floyd, who was killed when a police office knelt on his neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds while he cried for his life. I support justice for Breonna Taylor who was killed in her own home. There is a long list of black men and women who have been killed by the police in the United States including  Dominique Clayton, Eric Reason, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Ahmaud Arbery. I'm not American but I kneel with you and support the fight for justice.
