During this time, there have been protests worldwide over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in broad daylight and on camera. The protests for justice and against police brutality has been met with more police brutality. This has happened against citizens, journalists, and state and local politicians. Many people are peacefully protesting, but doing so in harm's way due to police officer attacks and escalations. This is also being done under the encouragement of the current administration, where there is no leadership or protections for the citizens to exercise their rights under the Constitution. That's why myself and co-host, Dag and Watney, want to make you aware of two organizations that are trying to help the people combat the systemic brutality that we face in the U.S. with our militarized police force.
